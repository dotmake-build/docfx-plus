<h1 id="glossary">Glossary</h1>

<h3 id="AdditionalContent"> additional content</h3>
<p>An extra file included in the help file used to define extra content or used as a supporting
file.  This can be an HTML topic, an image, script, style sheet, etc.  In earlier releases of the help file
builder, this was the way non-API content was included in the help file.  The preferred method of including such
content now is to use conceptual content.</p>
<p>See Also: <a href="#ConceptualContent">ConceptualContent</a></p>
<h3 id="buildassemblerexe">BuildAssembler.exe</h3>
<p>This is a tool supplied with Sandcastle that is used to build the help topics for conceptual and
reference builds.  It is passed a configuration file containing a list of build components to use in transforming
the topics into HTML and a manifest file that lists the topics to build.</p>
<p>See Also: <a href="#Sandcastle">Sandcastle</a></p>
<h3 id="CodeBlockComponent"> Code Block Component</h3>
<p>A custom build component that can be used to colorize code, add line numbering and/or collapsible
section, and import code from working source code files.  It can be used in both conceptual and reference builds.
The component is integrated with the SHFBand is also available as a standalone component from the
same project site for use in other tools or your own build scripts.</p>
<p>See Also: <a href="#Sandcastle">Sandcastle</a>, <a href="#SHFB">SHFB</a></p>
<h3 id="code-snippets-file">code snippets file</h3>
<p>A file used to store commonly used code snippets.  The snippets can be inserted into a conceptual
topic using the <code>CodeEntityReference</code> element.</p>
<h3 id="ConceptualBuild"> conceptual build</h3>
<p>A build that uses Sandcastle to produce help file topics using information extracted from
conceptual content topics and their related files.</p>
<p>See Also: <a href="#ReferenceBuild">ReferenceBuild</a>, <a href="#Sandcastle">Sandcastle</a></p>
<h3 id="ConceptualContent"> conceptual content</h3>
<p>A topic file that contains conceptual content.  These can be used to add usage notes,
walkthroughs, tutorials, etc. to a help file.  Conceptual topics use MAML rather than HTML to define their
content.</p>
<p>See Also: <a href="#AdditionalContent">AdditionalContent</a>, <a href="#MAML">MAML</a></p>
<h3 id="dependency">dependency</h3>
<p>See <a href="#Reference">reference</a>.</p>
<h3 id="documentation-source">documentation source</h3>
<p>An individual assembly (executable or DLL), an individual XML comments file, a Visual Studio project
file (C#, VB.NET, or J#), a Visual Studio solution file containing one or more of the noted project types, or a
wildcard item that results in a list of one or more of the previously mentioned file types.  These are used to
produce API documentation in a help project.  At least one assembly must be specified as a documentation source
in order to produce API help content.  Documentation sources are managed using the <strong>DocumentationSources</strong> project node in the <strong>Project Explorer</strong> window.</p>
<p>SolutionDocSource</p>
<h3 id="globally-unique-identifier-guid">Globally Unique Identifier, GUID</h3>
<p>A unique value that is associated with each conceptual topic and image in a project.  When
inserting links to topics or images, the ID is used to refer to them.  This allows you to alter the names or
locations of the topic files without having to change the name or location in each topic that references
them.</p>
<h3 id="MAML"> MAML</h3>
<p>An acronym that stands for Microsoft Assistance Markup Language.  Conceptual content topics are
composed of MAML elements.</p>
<p>See Also: <a href="#ConceptualContent">ConceptualContent</a></p>
<h3 id="Reference"> reference</h3>
<p>Also referred to as a <em>dependency</em>.  This is an assembly that is
referenced by one of the documented assemblies for base class information but is itself not documented as part of
the help project.  They are managed via the <strong>References</strong> project node in the <strong>Project Explorer</strong> window.  References can be GAC entries, assembly files, COM objects, or
Visual Studio project files.</p>
<h3 id="ReferenceBuild"> reference build</h3>
<p>A build that uses Sandcastle to produce help file topics using information extracted from managed
assemblies and their associated XML comments files.</p>
<p>See Also: <a href="#ConceptualBuild">ConceptualBuild</a>, <a href="#Sandcastle">Sandcastle</a></p>
<h3 id="Sandcastle"> Sandcastle</h3>
<p>Sandcastle is a set of tools originally produced by Microsoft that can be used to build help
files for .NET managed libraries, conceptual content, or a mix of both.  Microsoft officially discontinued
development in October 2012.  The Sandcastle tools have been merged with the SHFBproject and are
developed and supported there now as part of that project.</p>
<p>See Also: <a href="#SHFB">SHFB</a></p>
<h3 id="SHFB"> Sandcastle Help File Builder, SHFB</h3>
<p>The SHFBis a standalone tool used to automate Sandcastle.  It consists of a GUI
front end that helps you manage and build help file projects.  It uses a standard MSBuild format project file
which can also be built from the command line using MSBuild or integrated into Visual Studio builds or other
build scripts to produce a help file when your application projects are built.  In addition, it provides a set of
additional features beyond those supplied with Sandcastle that can improve your help file and make it easier to
deploy.  A Visual Studio integration package is also available for it that integrates the project management
and build features into VisualStudioMinVersionor later.</p>

<h3 id="token-token-file">token, token file</h3>
<p>A token is used as a replaceable tag within a topic and is represented using a <code>token</code> element.  The inner text of the element is a token name.  The tokens are defined
in a separate token file.  They are an easy way to represent common items that you use regularly such as a common
phrase or external link.</p>
