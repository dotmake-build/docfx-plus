<h2 id="BreakingChanges"> Breaking Changes</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>In the <code>HelpFileFormat</code> property, the <code>HtmlHelp1x</code> and <code>HtmlHelp2x</code> member values were renamed to <code>HtmlHelp1</code> and <code>MSHelp2</code> to match the common naming conventions.  The combination values were removed
since they were not used and were rather unwieldy.  Existing projects using the old values will be updated to
use the new values when opened and re-saved.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Build component and plug-in changes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Component configuration filenames are now required to have a <em>.components</em>
extension.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Plug-in assembly filenames are now required to have a <em>.plugins</em> extension.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The separate <em>Build Components</em> and <em>Plug-Ins</em> folders have been
combined into one common <em>Components and Plug-Ins</em> folder under the <em>Application Datafolder</em>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These changes allow plug-ins and build components that share dependencies to reside in the same folder.
It also prevents the help file builder from scanning assemblies and configuration files that are not related to
plug-ins and build components.  The help file builder will scan its own installation folder for component
configuration files and plug-in assemblies.  You may also place them there to support non-standard installations
of the help file builder (i.e. XCOPY deployments to build servers).  See the <a href="../../gettingstarted/specialfilepaths.html">Special Folder Locations</a> topic for more information.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The type of the <code>SyntaxFilters</code> project property has been changed from an
enumerated type to a string.  This was done to allow custom syntax filter generators (see below).  The value is a
comma separated list of syntax generator IDs.  The designer still uses a dropdown control that lets you pick
multiple values from the available generator IDs. In addition, the following special values can be entered in the
designer:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>None</code> - No syntax filters will be included.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>Standard</code> - The standard syntax filters will be included (C#, VB.NET, and
C++).</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>All</code> - All syntax filters will be included.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>AllButUsage</code> - All syntax filters will be included except those with
&quot;Usage&quot; in their ID (i.e. <code>VisualBasicUsage</code> and <code>XamlUsage</code>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Entering or selecting a set of filters that match one of the above special values will result in that
value appearing as the property's value. In addition, entering various alternate language names in the designer
property editor will automatically translate them to the appropriate syntax filters.  For example, entering &quot;cs,
vb&quot; will get translated to &quot;CSharp, VisualBasic&quot;.  Unknown ID values will be ignored.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Syntax filter generators are now defined using an <a href="../../customcomponents/createsyntaxfilter.html">external XML file</a> which allows you to add custom
syntax filter generators to the help file builder without having to modify its code and template files.  Filter
definition files should have a <em>.filters</em> extension and should be located in the custom build
components and plug-ins folder.  They can also be located in the help file builder's installation folder if you
need XCOPY deployment for a build server.  See the default filters file in the help file builder installation
folder for an example (<em>SandcastleBuilder.filters</em>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="SCJuly2009"> Sandcastle July 2009 Source Code Download Support</h2>
<p>An unofficial release of Sandcastle was made available in July 2009 as a source code only download.
Support for it in this release of the help file builder only includes using the XSL transformations and the
related resource files from it.  The executables from the last official Sandcastle release (May 2008) should be
used with them rather than the ones built from the source code.  Fully supporting the July 2009 executables
requires some modifications to the help file builder source code itself which would break compatibility with the
existing official release.  The help file builder source code is available if you want to rebuild it for use with
the July 2009 executables.  However, this is not necessary.</p>
<p>The current release of the Sandcastle Styles patch includes all changes from the July
2009 release in addition to all of the other bug fixes and updates ready for use with the May 2008 executables.
You only need the updates from the July 2009 release if you want to include the F# syntax filter or if you want
to create MS Help Viewer files.  If not, you can continue using the May 2008 release with or without the
Sandcastle Styles patch.</p>
<h2 id="OtherChanges"> Other Changes in This Release</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Added support for .NET 4.0.</p>
</li>
<li><p>F# projects created by Visual Studio 2010 can now be used as documentation sources.  However, they
will most likely fail to load because they use MSBuild 4.0 specific attributes in their projects files.  The help
file builder is currently built to use MSBuild 3.5 and cannot interpret the newer attributes.  If this happens,
you must add the assembly, XML comments file, and references to the help file builder project individually.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Added F# syntax rules to the code colorizer.  Use <code>fs</code>, <code>F#</code>, <code>FSharp</code>, or <code>FSScript</code> as the language identifier on <code>code</code> XML comment elements.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Added <code>x86</code>, <code>x64</code>, and <code>Win32</code>
as standard platform types in new help file builder projects.  These can be added manually to existing projects
if needed.  Open the project file in a text editor and do the following:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-xml">&lt;!-- Find these two property group definitions --&gt;
&lt;PropertyGroup Condition=&quot; '$(Configuration)|$(Platform)' == 'Debug|AnyCPU' &quot;&gt;
&lt;/PropertyGroup&gt;
&lt;PropertyGroup Condition=&quot; '$(Configuration)|$(Platform)' == 'Release|AnyCPU' &quot;&gt;
&lt;/PropertyGroup&gt;

&lt;!-- Paste these property group definitions in after them --&gt;
&lt;PropertyGroup Condition=&quot; '$(Configuration)|$(Platform)' == 'Debug|x86' &quot;&gt;
&lt;/PropertyGroup&gt;
&lt;PropertyGroup Condition=&quot; '$(Configuration)|$(Platform)' == 'Release|x86' &quot;&gt;
&lt;/PropertyGroup&gt;
&lt;PropertyGroup Condition=&quot; '$(Configuration)|$(Platform)' == 'Debug|x64' &quot;&gt;
&lt;/PropertyGroup&gt;
&lt;PropertyGroup Condition=&quot; '$(Configuration)|$(Platform)' == 'Release|x64' &quot;&gt;
&lt;/PropertyGroup&gt;
&lt;PropertyGroup Condition=&quot; '$(Configuration)|$(Platform)' == 'Debug|Win32' &quot;&gt;
&lt;/PropertyGroup&gt;
&lt;PropertyGroup Condition=&quot; '$(Configuration)|$(Platform)' == 'Release|Win32' &quot;&gt;
&lt;/PropertyGroup&gt;
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>Fixed a bug in <em>TOC.js</em> that caused the content pane to disappear at certain zoom
levels in Internet Explorer 8.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Fixed a bug in the code colorizer that caused it to truncate the title if a single quote appeared
within it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Fixed a bug in the API filter that caused excluded nested classes to appear in the help file if their
parent class was included.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Members of the API filter in which a majority but not all of the child elements are excluded now use
a different background color to make them stand out and better indicate their mixed state.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Added the <code>ExtensionMethodAddIn</code> add-in to the <strong>MRefBuilder</strong>
configuration file template to generate the additional extension method reflection information used by the
Sandcastle XSL transformations.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Added an <code>AutoDocumentDisposeMethods</code> option to the <code>ShowMissingComponent</code> and a corresponding project property in the <strong>Show Missing Tags</strong>
category.  This is used to indicate whether or not dispose methods are automatically documented if they are
missing the <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code> tag and for classes with compiler generated dispose methods.
It will be False in existing projects but defaults to True in new projects.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Added a new <code>ResourceItems</code> build action.  A file with a <em>.items</em>
extension will automatically receive this build action when added to a project.  It is an XML file that contains
resource item overrides that are used by the Sandcastle XSL transformations.  The editor for resource item files
will load all known resource items and let you edit their values.  Changed items are saved to the project's
resource item file.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The <code>ShowFeedbackControl</code> project property has been removed.  The new resource
item file editor can be used to edit the related feedback control resource items to add it to a project if it is
wanted.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If a project file documentation source imports another project into itself that contains reference
items, the reference items in the imported project are now ignored so that they do not prevent the documentation
source project file from being parsed. If they are needed by MRefBuilder, the imported reference items can be
added as reference items in the help file builder project.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When viewing the log file in the <strong>Build Output</strong> window, the content can be filtered to show
only warnings and errors in each build step.  The filter setting is persisted across sessions.  It is also used
when viewing output from a failed preview topic build.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Added ASP.NET as an option to the <code>SyntaxFilters</code> property
(<code>AspNet</code>).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Added F# as an option to the <code>SyntaxFilters</code> property
(<code>FSharp</code>).</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>This requires the XSL transformations and resource files from the July 2009 Sandcastle source code
release.  These changes are available for use with the May 2008 release by downloading and applying the
Sandcastle Styles patch.  A copy of the F# syntax declaration generator component is included with
the help file builder that is compatible with the May 2008 Sandcastle release.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><p>Added the <code>MSHelpViewer</code> value to the <code>HelpFileFormat</code>
property options.  Preliminary support for building Microsoft Help Viewer files has been added.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>This requires the XSL transformations and resource files from the July 2009 Sandcastle source code
release.  These changes are available for use with the May 2008 release by downloading and applying the
Sandcastle Styles patch.  However, full MS Help Viewer support is not yet implemented since
Sandcastle does not appear to add the necessary table of contents metadata to the topics yet. This will be fully
implemented as the tools become available and changes are made in Sandcastle to support it.</p>
