<h1 id="version-1800-alpha">Version 1.8.0.0 (Alpha)</h1>

<h2 id="NewFormat"> A New Project File Format and a New Look</h2>
<p>The main goal of this release was to rework the help file builder project file format and build engine
to ready them for use in a Visual Studio package that will provide full Visual Studio integration in a future
release.  This resulted in a number of major changes.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>Although Visual Studio integration is planned for a future release, the standalone GUI will still be
produced and supported for those who do not use Visual Studio.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><p>The help file builder now uses an MSBuild project file to store its settings.  Along with the
associated MSBuild tasks and target definition file, this allows you to build help file builder projects using
MSBuild.  It also makes it possible to create a Visual Studio package that will let you work with help file
builder projects from within Visual Studio just like any other project in a solution file (planned for a future
release).</p>
</li>
<li><p>A <code>SHFBROOT</code> environment variable is now used to locate
the root help file builder folder for various tools.  The value should point to the root installation folder.
The installer will create the environment variable automatically but you may need to reboot in order for it to
take effect.  You will also need to manually define it on any system to which you manually copy the help file
builder tools.</p>
</li>
<li><p>With the use of an MSBuild project file format, <em>SandcastleBuilderConsole.exe</em>
was rendered obsolete and has been removed.  Use <a href="../../gettingstarted/consolebuild.html">MSBuild</a>, <a href="../../gettingstarted/teambuild.html">Team Build</a>, or another such tool to build a help
file project from the command line or in automated scripts.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Due to the change in format, help file builder projects from prior versions will need to be
converted before use with the latest release.  Once converted, they cannot be changed back or used with prior
versions of the help file builder.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Several project properties have been removed or altered and their functionality has moved elsewhere
in the standalone GUI.  See the <a href="#WhereIsIt">Where Did That Feature Go?</a> section below for
details.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The NDoc-style GUI has been replaced by one that looks more like Visual Studio.  This was required
as by moving to an MSBuild project format, the conceptual content and supporting files are now part of the
project and appear in the project file as build items.  The new GUI provides a <strong>Project Explorer</strong>
window that lets you manage these items.  The <strong>Properties</strong> window retains the NDoc-like
property grid and is used to edit the various non-file project properties.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>See the <a href="../../gettingstarted/overview.html">Sandcastle Help File Builder Overview</a> topic for more information on
the new GUI and how to use it effectively.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><p>The underlying namespace in the code for the GUI changed so any prior user preferences will not be
carried forward when you first open the new version.  You can set them up again via the <strong>File | UserPreferences</strong> menu option.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>It is no longer necessary to define external editors in the <strong>User Preferences</strong>
dialog to edit files such as XML files, style sheets, HTML files, etc.  Common text-based file types recognized
by filename extension will be edited within the GUI by default.  As such, you do not need to add any custom
editor associations for them in your user preferences.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Assemblies to Document</strong> are now referred to using the more generic term <em>Documentation Sources</em>.  A documentation source can be an individual assembly (executable or
DLL), an individual XML comments file, a Visual Studio project file (C#, VB.NET, or J#), a Visual Studio solution
file containing one or more of the noted project types, or a wildcard item that results in a list of one or more
of the previously mentioned file types.  Documentation sources are now managed using the <strong>Documentation Sources</strong> project node in the <strong>Project Explorer</strong>
window.</p>
<p>SolutionDocSource</p>
</li>
<li><p>A <code>Configuration</code> and a <code>Platform</code> option can be
defined to determine which assemblies are used in solution and project documentation sources.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Dependencies</strong> are now referred to using the term <em>References</em>.  The old <strong>Dependencies</strong> property has been removed from the
Properties window.  They are now managed via the <strong>References</strong> project node in the <strong>Project Explorer</strong> window.  References can be GAC entries, assembly files, COM objects, or
Visual Studio project files.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>While COM references are supported in the project file and will be handled correctly at build
time, they cannot be added to the project via the standalone GUI.  An alternative is to add the COM-callable
wrapper assemblies as references instead.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><p>All build step script files (<em>.bat</em>) have been replaced with MSBuild project
files (<em>.proj</em>) with corresponding build tasks.  This allows for better extensibility either
directly or through plug-ins.  In addition, it allows for support of Unicode values in such properties as the
help filename.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The code has been heavily refactored and some project option collection classes and property names
have been changed to reflect their purpose in relation to the MSBuild project file format.  Others have been
removed as they are no longer relevant.  As such, expect build errors in any custom plug-ins that you have
created.  Most of the affected objects and properties are listed below.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="WhereIsIt"> Where Did That Feature Go?</h2>
<p>Several features and project options were removed and their functionality is now handled in a different
manner.  The following items will help you locate the old feature and determine how to do the same thing in the
new version of the help file builder.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Console Mode Builder (SandcastleBuilderConsole.exe)</p>
<ul>
<li>With the use of an MSBuild project file format, <em>SandcastleBuilderConsole.exe</em>
was rendered obsolete and has been removed.  Use <a href="../../gettingstarted/consolebuild.html">MSBuild</a>, <a href="../../gettingstarted/teambuild.html">Team Build</a>, or another such tool to build a help
file project from the command line or in automated scripts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Assemblies to Document</p>
<ul>
<li>This has been replaced by a more generic term: <em>Documentation Sources</em>.  These are
added to the <strong>Documentation Sources</strong> project node in the <strong>Project Explorer</strong>
window.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Project and Namespace Summaries</p>
<ul>
<li>Edit these via the <strong>Project Properties</strong> window.  The <code>NamespaceSummaries</code> and <code>ProjectSummary</code> properties can be found
in the <strong>Comments</strong> category.  Click the &quot;...&quot; button to the right of each property to open
the expanded property editor.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>The AdditionalContent Property</p>
<ul>
<li>Additional content files are now handled as project file items.  They should have a <code>BuildAction</code> value of <code>Content</code>.  The folder structure of the
items determines their location in the compiled help file and, for HTML and .topic files in the absence of a site
map file, their order and layout in the table of contents.  Items at the root level end up in the root level of
the help file and projects in subfolders end up in like-named subfolders in the compiled help file.  For control
over how the files appear in the table of contents, add a site map file to the project and use it to arrange the
additional content files.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>The AdditionalContent.ContentSiteMap Property</p>
<ul>
<li>Site map files are handled as project file items.  They should have a <code>BuildAction</code>
value of <code>SiteMap</code>.  Multiple site map and content layout files (used for conceptual
content) can be specified in a project.  The <code>SortOrder</code> property on them determines in
what order their content is merged into the table of contents.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>The AdditionalContent.TopicFileTransform Property</p>
<ul>
<li>Topic file transformations used for <em>.topic</em> files are handled as project file
items.  They should have a <code>BuildAction</code> value of <code>TopicTransform</code>.
Note that only the first <code>TopicTransform</code> item found during a build will be used.  All
others will be ignored.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>The ConceptualContent Property</p>
<ul>
<li>All conceptual content file types are handled as project file items.  See the following items for
details.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>The ConceptualContent.CodeSnippets Property</p>
<ul>
<li>Code snippets files are handled as project file items.  They should have a <code>BuildAction</code>
value of <code>CodeSnippets</code>.  Multiple code snippets files can exist in a project and all will
be included in the build.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>The ConceptualContent.Images Property</p>
<ul>
<li>Conceptual content image files are handled as project file items.  They should have a <code>BuildAction</code> value of <code>Image</code>.  Image properties such as their ID
and alternate text are managed via the project file item properties.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>The ConceptualContent.Tokens Property</p>
<ul>
<li>Tokens are now handled via token files which are project file items.  They should have a <code>BuildAction</code> value of <code>Tokens</code>.  Multiple token files can exist in
a project and all will be included in the build.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>The ConceptualContent.Topics Property</p>
<ul>
<li>Conceptual topic files are handled as project file items.  They now have an extension of <em>.aml</em> and should have a <code>BuildAction</code> value of <code>None</code>.
Content layout files determine which topics are compiled into the help file and their order in the table of
contents.  They have a <em>.content</em> file extension and a <code>BuildAction</code>
value of <code>ContentLayout</code>.  As noted above, multiple site map and content layout files can
be specified in a project.  The <code>SortOrder</code> property on them determines in what order
their content is merged into the table of contents.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>Topics added via the content layout editor are automatically added to the project file.  In
addition, topics are now tracked by their ID number so you are free to rearrange the files in the project folders
without having to update their location in the content layout file.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><p>The Dependencies Property</p>
<ul>
<li>Dependencies are now referred to as <em>References</em>.  References can be GAC entries,
assemblies, COM objects, or Visual Studio project files.  They are added to the <strong>References</strong>
project node in the <strong>Project Explorer</strong> window.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Editing Conceptual Content Layout and Related Topic Properties</p>
<ul>
<li>Add a <strong>Content Layout</strong> file to the project.  This lets you edit the layout
of the conceptual topics and manage their properties much like the conceptual content editor in prior versions
of the help file builder.  See also: <a href="#TopicsProp">The ConceptualContent.Topics Property</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Inserting Image, Token, and Code Snippet References Into Topics</p>
<ul>
<li>Image, token, code snippet, and code entity references are now all handled by the <strong>Entity References</strong> window.  Select the type of entity to insert in the window's dropdown.
Then drag and drop or double click the item to insert it into the topic.  A <strong>Refresh</strong> button is available
to update the available items if you make changes to their related project files.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>New Project From NDoc Project/Visual Studio Project</p>
<ul>
<li>The option to create a new project from an NDoc project (or various other project types) can be
found in the <strong>File | New Project from Other Format</strong> menu option.  The option to create a project from a
Visual Studio solution or project has been removed.  Visual Studio 2005/2008 solution and project files are
supported natively as documentation sources.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Locating Third-Party Custom Build Components, Plug-Ins, and User-Defined Templates</p>
<ul>
<li>To be Vista-compliant by not making changes to the installation folder, all files such as
third-party custom build components, custom plug-ins, build component data cache files, and user-defined template
files should now be located in subfolders under the <em>EWSoftware\Sandcastle Help File Builder</em>
folder in the <em>Common Application Data</em> or <em>Local Application Data</em> folder.
See the <a href="../../gettingstarted/specialfilepaths.html">Special Folder Locations</a> topic for more information.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>Performing a build using one of the cached data components will create the root local application
data folder automatically.  However, if you need to place files there before then, you will need to create the
folder manually.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="BugFixes"> Bug Fixes</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Fixed a couple of bugs in the <strong>Hierarchical TOC</strong> plug-in that caused the
namespaces to be nested incorrectly.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Fixed the <strong>Code Block Component</strong> so that nested code blocks in conceptual
content are imported correctly.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Fixed a bug in the <strong>Split TOC</strong> option that caused the TOC items to be
excluded if it was set on the first content item.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Exceptions in the namespace generation step in partial builds are now ignored so that you can get
into the <strong>Namespace Comments</strong> dialog to fix the issue.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Fixed a bug in the HTML extract tool that caused it to fail on nodes without an associated file.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="OtherFeatures"> Other Changes and New Features</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Documented assemblies and reference (dependency) assemblies are no longer copied to the working
folder for the build.  Instead, they are resolved and parsed in place at their given location.  This prevents
issues with similarly named assemblies overwriting each other in the working folder.</p>
</li>
<li><p>XML comments files are still copied to the working folder as they may be modified.  Duplicates are
given a unique name if a file by the same name already exists in the working folder.  This prevents the loss of
comments due to XML comments files in different projects that use the same name.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The project used by the build process is a clone of the active project. As such, it can be modified
without affecting the active project.</p>
</li>
<li><p>All tool/build engine warnings and errors are now reported with a code and in a format compatible
with the  Visual Studio Error List tool window.  The warning and error codes are <a href="../../errorsandwarnings/errorsandwarnings.html">documented</a> and provide information about what the
error means along with possible solutions.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Just prior to building a Help 1 (CHM) file, warnings are issued if the working path, the <code>HTMLHelpName</code> property, or any filename contains &quot;.h&quot; or a comma.  Paths or files
containing &quot;.h&quot; or a comma can cause odd compiler crashes.  If you see this warning and the <a href="../../faq/help1compilererrors.html#HHC3002">help compiler fails</a>, change the names of
the paths or files listed in the warning(s).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Added an <code>allowMissingSource</code> option to the <strong>Code BlockComponent</strong> to allow missing source code files/regions to generate warnings rather than errors.  It
also gives a more descriptive error when it fails to find a required attribute.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Added <strong>All</strong> and <strong>None</strong> buttons to the <strong>Namespace Comments</strong>
dialog to check or uncheck all namespaces at once.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The default presentation style in new projects has changed from <code>Prototype</code>
to <code>VS2005</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Implemented basic find and replace support in the topic editor window (Ctrl+F and Ctrl+H).  Also
added Goto Line (Ctrl+G) and expanded the number of elements that can be inserted from the tool bar.</p>
</li>
<li><p>All help windows are now opened non-modally.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Thanks to Golo Roden for the Python keywords and code colorizer rule definitions.  Use the language
ID <code>python</code> or <code>py</code> to colorize a code block as Python code.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the code download, all help file builder solutions and projects are now in Visual Studio 2008
SP1 format.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The help file content has been converted to MAML and uses the VS2005 style.</p>
</li>
