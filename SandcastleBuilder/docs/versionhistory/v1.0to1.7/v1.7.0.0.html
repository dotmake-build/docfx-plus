<h2 id="BreakingChanges"> Potential Breaking Changes</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>The default configuration for all cached build components has changed.  They no longer store
their cache files in the help file builder folder.  Instead, they store them in the <em>%APPDATA%\EWSoftware\Sandcastle Help File Builder\Cache</em> folder.  This removes the need to
run the help file builder as an administrator under Vista x64 when using the cached build components.  If you
are using them, you ++<strong>must</strong>++ remove them from the project
and re-add them so that they pick up the new default configuration.  You can also delete the cache files from the
old location.  You can find them in the <strong>.\BuildComponents\Cache</strong> folder under the main
help file builder installation folder.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The default configuration for the <strong>Cached Framework Comments Index Data</strong>
custom build component has changed.  If you are using it, you ++<strong>must</strong>++
remove it from the project and re-add it so that it picks up the new default configuration.  You can also delete
the <strong>Comments.cache</strong> file as the naming method has changed and the old version is
obsolete.  You can find it in the <strong>.\BuildComponents\Cache</strong> folder under the main help
file builder installation folder or in the new folder noted above if you moved the cache files.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A new <code>insertConceptual</code> configuration option was added to the build
component definition configuration file.  It is used to define a build component's placement within the <strong>conceptual.config</strong> file.  The existing <code>insert</code> option will
continue to be used for the reference build configuration file (<strong>sandcastle.config</strong>).  If
either element is omitted from a component's definition, it will not be merged into the given configuration file.
This is a change from prior behavior which inserted the component at the start of the configuration file if a
placement option was not specified.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Components defined in the project's <code>ComponentConfigurations</code> property
will be merged into the appropriate configuration files based on the presence of the <code>insert</code>
and <code>insertConceptual</code> configuration elements.  As such, the settings will be shared and
the conceptual content will match the reference content in appearance.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A distinction is now made between JScript and JavaScript in the code colorizer to match the
usage in Sandcastle.  JScript now has its own rule set and is considered to be JScript.NET.  JavaScript is
regular JavaScript.  Code examples using &quot;JScript&quot; or one of its variants as the language will be connected to
the JScript language filter.  Code examples using &quot;JavaScript&quot; or one of its variants as the language will be
connected to the JavaScript language filter.</p>
</li>
<li><p>&quot;XAML&quot; has been added as a separate language in the code colorizer rules so that it can be
correctly connected to the XAML language filter.</p>
</li>
<li><p>To support conceptual content, the following changes have been made to the build steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <code>CreateConfig</code> build step has been renamed <code>CreateBuildAssemblerConfigs</code>.  This step will now create the <strong>conceptual.config</strong>
file as well.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The <code>BuildHelpTopics</code> build step has been renamed <code>BuildReferenceTopics</code>.  This builds the reference (API) help topics.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Added the build steps <code>CopyConceptualContent</code>, <code>CreateConceptualTopicConfigs</code>, <code>MergeTablesOfContents</code>, and <code>BuildConceptualTopics</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The <strong>BuildHelpTopics.bat</strong> script file has been renamed <strong>BuildReferenceTopics.bat</strong>.  A new script file, <strong>BuildConceptualTopics.bat</strong>,
was added to build the conceptual help topics.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If both conceptual content and additional content are included in a project, conceptual
content will take precedence.  Any additional content will appear after the conceptual content in the table of
contents.  Likewise, if specified, the default topic and split TOC topic in the conceptual content will take
precedence.  The equivalent settings in the additional content will only be used if not specified in the
conceptual content.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>A bug in the standard <code>ResolveConceptualLinksComponent</code> causes any
specified inner text on <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tags to be ignored and instead it always uses the
title.  I have reimplemented the component to fix that bug and added a couple of new features (see below).  As
such, any links you may have in your conceptual content files will start showing the inner text when built with
the help file builder.  You may need to review your documentation and either remove or update the inner text to
something more appropriate on your links.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="NonBreaking"> Non-breaking Changes in Behavior</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>The requirement that an XML comments file be associated with an assembly has been removed and
the build behavior has changed for cases where the XML comments file for an assembly is blank.  In such cases,
the XML comments file is ignored and no comments will be associated with the assembly.  This allows you to build
a help file for an assembly without a comments file and is useful in a couple of the new plug-ins.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Wildcards are now supported in the <code>AssemblyPath</code> and <code>XmlCommentsPath</code> properties on each of the documented assemblies.  This allows you to add
one entry that will include multiple assemblies and/or comments files for documenting.  This is also useful for
documenting website projects in which the last part of the assembly names and comments files can change each time
the website is published.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The behavior of the console mode builder's <code>-assembly</code> and <code>-comments</code> command line options has been adjusted accordingly to account for the new
wildcard support.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The log file will list all assemblies and XML comments files copied during the <code>ValidatingAssemblies</code> build step so that you can verify it found the correct files.
Warnings are also issued if duplicate files are copied that overwrite previously copied files in the working
folder.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The <code>PurgeDuplicateTopics</code> project property has been removed as
duplicates are now handled via the <strong>MergeDuplicates.xsl</strong> Sandcastle transformation
immediately after <strong>MRefBuilder</strong> has been executed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The <strong>Additional Content</strong> property category is now called <strong>Additional and Conceptual Content</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The <code>ContentSiteMap</code> and <code>TopicFileTransform</code>
properties are now sub-properties of the <code>AdditionalContent</code> property.  You must expand it
to see them.  This change was made to make their association with the additional content clear and to avoid
incorrectly associating them with the new <code>ConceptualContent</code> property which does not make
use of them.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The <code>AdditonalContent</code> and <code>ContentSiteMap</code>
properties now share a common property editor to make it easier to edit their settings together and to make their
association more apparent.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The help file builder will now include the necessary .NET Framework comments files based on the
setting of the <code>FrameworkVersion</code> property.  This ensures that all of the necessary
comments files are included when using the .NET 3.0 and .NET 3.5 Frameworks.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The <code>CachedCopyFromIndexComponent</code> used for the comments index now names
its cache files after the language and framework version.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Renamed the <code>SyntaxFilters.ScriptSharp</code> value to <code>JavaScript</code>
as that is what it renders and this makes it more apparent that it can be used for other projects such as those
that use the AjaxDoc plug-in.  The old value will be translated to the new value automatically when an older
project that contains it is loaded.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Added a customized version of the JavaScript declaration syntax generator component that will
correctly document normal JavaScript.  It will only convert the first letter of each member name to lowercase
when documenting a Script# project.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The <code>ShowMissingComponent</code> messages are now localized.  The messages
appear in each of the <strong>SharedBuilderContent_[lang].xml</strong> files in the help file builder's <strong>.\SharedContent</strong> folder.  The component also inserts the &quot;missing namespace&quot; message as
well rather than the build process.  A <code>contentFile</code> configuration option was added to the
component that is used to specify the file containing the localized messages.  If omitted, it defaults to using
the English message text.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Due to a significant change in the way the language filters work in the Hana and Prototype
presentation styles, the <code>PostTransformComponent</code> no longer connects example code blocks
to the language filter in those presentation styles.  Given the way they are implemented, this feature would be
better handled in the transformations and script files themselves.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The default topic transformation files now contain a default set of <code>MSHelp:Attr</code>
elements for (name/value) <code>DocSet/NetFramework</code>, <code>DocSet/{@HtmlHelpName}</code>, <code>Locale/{@Locale}</code>, and <code>TargetOS/Windows</code> where the replacement
tags will be replaced with the appropriate project option at build time.  Any additional XML data island elements
from the transformed topics will be merged with the default set.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Generate1xIndex.bat</strong>, <strong>Generate1xTOC.bat</strong>, <strong>GenerateWebsiteTOC.bat</strong>, and <strong>TocToWebContents.xsl</strong> have been
removed.  In their place is a new script template, <strong>ExtractHtmlInfo.bat</strong>, that runs a new
tool that extracts TOC and keyword information from the HTML files to produce a better index and TOC with proper
encoding support for foreign languages for the HTML Help 1 file and a TOC for websites.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If a new project is created from a Visual Studio 2008 solution or project, the <code>FrameworkVersion</code> property will be set based on the highest target framework specified
within the Visual Studio project.  This also applies to Visual Studio projects imported by the console mode
builder.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Conceptual"> Conceptual Content Support</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Support for building conceptual content in addition to reference (API) content has been fully
integrated into the build process.  The new <code>ConceptualContent</code> property in the <strong>Additional and Conceptual Content</strong> property category allows you to manage the conceptual
content.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The current conceptual content editor allows you to add, edit, and delete tokens, images, and
conceptual topics in the project.  The layout of the conceptual topics in the editor will determine their layout
in the table of contents when built similar to how the site map works for additional content.  Enhanced design
support will be added in a later release.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Full support for colorized code blocks is included.  Simply specify the <code>code</code>
elements as you would in XML comments using all of the same options.  This include support for imported code
blocks.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The post-transform component is also supported and thus logos can be added to the conceptual
topic headers.  The conceptual build shares the same component configurations as the reference build so they will
maintain the same look.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Documentation for conceptual content and its use with the help file builder is rather sparse at
the moment.  This will also be addressed in a future release.</p>
</li>
<li><p>An improved version of the <code>ResolveConceptualLinksComponent</code> has been
added with the following features and fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Broken links use the <strong>None</strong> style rather than the <strong>Index</strong>
style so that it is apparent that they do not work.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The inner text from the conceptual link is used if specified. See the <strong>PotentialBreaking Changes</strong> section above as this may affect any existing conceptual content that you have.</p>
</li>
<li><p>On broken links, when the <code>showBrokenLinkText</code> option is true and
there is no inner text, the target value is displayed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Conceptual link targets can include an optional anchor name from within the target such as
&quot;#Name&quot; (i.e. <code>&lt;link xlink:href=&quot;3bdb6eb5-5e23-51c2-0051-3e224f82c201#Section2&quot; /&gt;</code>).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Unnecessary whitespace is removed from the link text.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If the companion file contains a <code>&lt;linkText&gt;</code> element and no
inner text is specified, its value will be used for the link text rather than the title.  This allows for a
shorter title or description to use as the default link text.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Deprecated"> Additional Content Models Deprecated</h2>
<p>See the <a href="../../addconceptcontent/addconceptcontent.html">Conceptual and Additional Content</a> topic for details.</p>
<h2 id="OtherChanges"> Other Changes in This Release</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Added support for the <code>&lt;inheritdoc /&gt;</code> XML comments tag.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Added the <code>GenerateInheritedDocumentation</code> build step to handle
generation of inherited documentation.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Added the <code>FeedbackEMailLinkText</code> project property.  If specified with a
feedback e-mail address, the text in this property will be used as the link text.  If left blank, the e-mail
address will be used.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The <code>BinaryTOC</code> and <code>IncludeFavorites</code> properties
are now found in their own category in the property grid (<strong>HTML Help 1</strong>).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Added the <strong>MS Help 2</strong> property category containing the following new
project properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>CollectionTocStyle</code> - This defines the collection table of contents
style used when plugged into an MS Help 2 collection.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>HelpAttributes</code> - A collection of additional help attributes to add
to the XML data island in each generated API topic.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>HelpFileVersion</code> - Specify the version number that should be
applied to the help file.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>IncludeStopWordList</code> - Indicate whether or not to include the stop
word list used to identify words to omit from Help 2 full text search index.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>PlugInNamespaces</code> - Specify a comma-separated list of namespaces
that the collection will be plugged into when deployed using <strong>H2Reg.exe</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>When performing a build that includes producing an MS Help 2 file, a valid set of collection
files and a configuration file for <strong>H2Reg.exe</strong> are now produced as well.  They are located
in the output folder with the help file.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Added the project property <code>BuildLogFile</code> that allows you to specify an
alternate location and name for the build log file.  If not set, it defaults to the filename <strong>LastBuild.log</strong> and stores it in the output folder identified by the <code>OutputPath</code> project property.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The log file is now in XML format to allow for running it through an XSL transform to make it
more readable.  A default XSL transform is supplied with the GUI (<strong>Templates\TransformBuildLog.xsl</strong>)
and it is used in the GUI's log viewer dialog.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Added the <code>IndentHtml</code> project property as a debugging aid.  When set to
true, the HTML rendered by <strong>BuildAssembler</strong> is indented to make it more readable.  Leave
it set to false to produce more compact HTML.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Added a <strong>&quot;-vsimport=solution|project,configName&quot;</strong> option to the console
mode builder that lets you specify a Visual Studio solution or project file from which to import the assemblies
and XML comments files to document for the named configuration.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Added a <strong>&quot;-helpattr=name,value&quot;</strong> option to the console mode builder that
lets you specify additional MS Help 2 help attribute name/value pairs to add to the XML data island in each API
topic.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The <strong>Namespace Summaries</strong> dialog box has been completely reworked.  It
now uses a partial build to gather the namespace information which will prevent the &quot;assembly not found&quot; errors
that could occur due to nested dependencies that could not always be properly detected.  In addition, namespaces
can now be filtered by assembly and/or by some search text or a regular expression.  A list of assemblies in
which the selected namespace appears is also shown.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If comments for a class called <code>NamespaceDoc</code> within a namespace appear
in the XML comments files, those comments will be used as the namespace comments.  To keep the class from being
included in the help file, leave off the <code>public</code> keyword and mark it with a <code>CompilerGenerated</code> attribute.  See the <a href="../../propertieswindow/namespacedoc.html">Using NamespaceDoc and NamespaceGroupDoc Classes</a>
help topic for details.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Added a new <code>keepSeeTags</code> option to the <strong>Code Block Component</strong>
that allows <code>&lt;see&gt;</code> tags that appear within the code to be passed through as-is so
that they are rendered as clickable links to the referenced help topic (project topics or online MSDN topics).
This option is also supported in additional content files on colorized <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> tags
but will only resolve links to project help topics.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Added a new <code>filter</code> option to the <strong>Code Block Component</strong>
that allows you to specify whether or not a code block is connected to the appropriate language filter.  If
omitted or set to true, it will be connected.  If set to false, it will not be connected.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The attribute name <code>language</code> is now recognized by the colorizer and the
code block component as an acceptable alternative for the <code>lang</code> attribute name.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The <code>CodeBlockComponent</code> and <code>PostTransformComponent</code>
where reworked to allow their use in conceptual content builds.  This allows code blocks in conceptual content
files to be colorized using the same options as in reference content builds.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Added the <strong>MS Help 2 Attributes</strong> component which is used to insert
additional help attributes into the XML data island in each generated API topic.  Support for this component is
built into the help file builder via the <code>HelpAttributes</code> project property.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Abstract classes that implement the <code>IPlugIn</code> interface are now ignored
when looking for plug-ins to load.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Added the following new plug-ins:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="../../plugins/addreflinksplugin.html">Additional Reference Links Plug-In</a> - This is used to add additional
reference link targets to the <strong>Reflection Index Data</strong> and <strong>Resolve ReferenceLinks</strong> build components so that links can be created to other third party help in a Help 2 collection
or to other online MSDN content.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="../../plugins/dbcsfixplugin.html">DBCS Fix for CHM Builds Plug-In</a> - This is designed to modify the
HTML files and alter the build so as to overcome the encoding issues encountered when building HTML Help 1 (.chm)
files for various foreign languages.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Hierarchical TOC Plug-In - This is used to rearrange the table of contents such that
namespaces are nested within their parent namespaces rather than appearing as a flat list of all namespaces at
the root level.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Script# Reflection File Fixer - This is used to fix up the reflection file produced from
assemblies created by the <strong>Script#</strong> compiler so that they are documented correctly.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="../../plugins/tocexcludeplugin.html">Table of Contents Exclusion Plug-In</a> - This is used to exclude API
members from the table of contents via the <code>&lt;tocexclude /&gt;</code> XML comment tag.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>The <strong>AjaxDoc Plug-In</strong> now supports the <code>ApiFilter</code>
property.  Other plug-ins like it that generate their own reflection information can also apply the API filter
manually by using the new <code>ApplyManualApiFilter</code> method on the <code>BuildProcess</code>
object.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The <strong>Completion Notification</strong> plug-in now supports an optional XSL
transform filename option.  If specified and the log file is to be attached to the e-mail, the log file is ran
through the transform and the resulting HTML file is attached in its place.  If not specified, the raw log file
is attached.  The default transform can be used by specifying **{@SHFBFolder}Templates\TransformBuildLog.xsl**.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The <strong>Output Deployment</strong> plug-in now correctly supports relative file
paths for the deployment locations.  Relative file paths will be relative to the project file folder.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The table of contents entries for additional content items can now be split such that some
appear before and some after the API topics.  The <code>ContentPlacement</code> property's setting
will be ignored if the table of contents is split via a custom tag in one of the additional content files or a <a href="../../addconceptcontent/sitemapeditor.html">site map</a> is defined that specifies a split table
of contents.  In such cases, items prior to the entry with the &quot;split&quot; option will appear before the API content.
The item with the &quot;split&quot; option and all items after it will appear below the API content.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Fixed a bug in the component configuration merging code that could cause the wrong component
configuration to be replaced when more than one instance of the same component appeared in the project
configuration.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Fixed a bug in <code>ShowMissingComponent</code> that caused the link in
auto-documented constructors to point to the constructor topic rather than the class topic.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Updated the <code>ShowMissingComponent</code> so that it auto-documents
constructors on the class's member and overloads list pages as well.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Added the <code>ShowMissingTypeParams</code> project property.  When set to true
(the default), it will show a &quot;missing&quot; message if generic type or method type parameter documentation is
missing.  This maps to the equivalent parameter added to the <code>ShowMissingComponent</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The <code>IntelliSenseComponent</code>, <code>PostTransformComponent</code>,
and <code>VersionInfoComponent</code> were updated to handle multiple assembly references in an API
topic.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Fixed a bug in the <code>PostTransformComponent</code> that caused the VS2005
member list pages to be laid out incorrectly when using a logo and the version builder's framework menu was
present.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Fixed a bug in the code colorizer rules for &quot;//&quot; style line comments that contained a &quot;/*&quot;
which was incorrectly interpreted as the start of a block comment.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Fixed the XML colorizer rules so that they recognize string literals that span lines.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The code block component and additional content files can now extract commented regions from
within XML, XAML, and SQL scripts.  Just surround the snippet with comment lines containing <code>#region</code> and <code>#endregion</code> markers.</p>
</li>
<li><p>All logo placement options are now supported by the default topic transformation files.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If <code>&lt;MSHelp:Keyword Index=&quot;K&quot; Term=&quot;[term]&quot; /&gt;</code> tags exist in the
XML data island in additional content files, the terms will now appear in the CHM file's index.  The SHFB help
file's additional content is now indexed using this method.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Fixed a JavaScript error in the website output that occurred if the full text search did not
find any results.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The <strong>Index.aspx</strong> page now supports a <code>topic</code>
query string parameter.  If set to the path of a page in the website, it will display that page instead of the

<p>A set of custom code providers is now available that simplifies obtaining XML comments files for C#
