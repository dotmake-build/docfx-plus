<h1 id="site-map-file-editor">Site Map File Editor</h1>

<p>Adding a site map file to the project and setting its <code>BuildAction</code> to <code>SiteMap</code> allows you to define the table of contents layout for the additional content
markdown and HTML files.  The layout in the site map file can differ from the physical folder structure of the
content files.</p>
<h2 id="EditorWindow"> The Site Map Editor Window</h2>
<p>The structure of the site map file is the same as that used for ASP.NET web sites but it only makes use
of the <code>title</code> and <code>url</code> attributes on the <code>siteMapNode</code>
elements.  In addition, it adds a custom <code>isDefault</code> attribute to the default topic
element, a custom <code>splitTOC</code> attribute to the topic where the table of contents should be
split with API topics appearing below it, and custom <code>isExpanded</code> and <code>isSelected</code> attributes to track the expanded/ collapsed and last used topic states for
the editor.  For more information on the structure of site map files, see the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/yy2ykkab%28v=vs.140%29">ASP.NET Site Maps</a> help topic.  You can edit the site map file from within the help
file builder by double-clicking it in the Project Explorer window or by selecting the <strong>Open</strong> option from
its context menu.  The site map editor window is shown below.</p>
<p align="center">
<img alt="Site Map Editor" src="../../images/SiteMapEditor.png">
</p>
<p>The left side of the window shows the table of contents as it is currently defined.  Entries can be
arranged hierarchically to any number of levels.  The right side of the window shows the properties for the
currently selected entry.  You can modify the topic's details at any time.  Changes are stored automatically
before moving off to another topic in the tree.  Files defined in the site map do not have to appear as
additional content items in the project.  Any files in the site map that are not found in the defined additional
content items at build time are copied over to the root output folder automatically.</p>
<p>The <strong>Find</strong> textbox allows you to search for a topic by filename or display name.  Enter some
text to find and hit Enter or click the <strong>Go</strong> button to start the search.  Hit Enter or click <strong>Go</strong>
again to find subsequent matches.  Matches are found by doing a case-insensitive search of the topic filename
and display names.</p>
<p>The tree supports drag and drop to re-order the topics.  Simply click and hold the left mouse button
on a topic and then drag it to its new location.  When you drop it on a topic, it is inserted immediately after
the target item.  If you hold down the <strong>Shift</strong> key while dropping an item, it will become a child of the
target item.</p>
<div class="TIP">
<h5>Tip</h5>
<p>Dragging a topic from the site map editor and dropping it into an editor window containing an HTML
file will create a link to the item in the topic that is being edited.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="Commands"> Available Options and Commands</h2>
<p>The options that can be modified for a topic appear on the right side of the window and are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Topic Filename</p>
<ul>
<li>This read-only property displays the project file related to the site map entry.  The two buttons
to the right of the currently associated topic filename let you do the following:</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Associate Topic</strong> - This button allows you to associate a different
topic file with a site map file entry or add an association to an empty container node.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Clear Topic Association</strong> - This button allows you to clear the topic
file associated with a site map file entry converting it into an empty container node.  The node will not
have a topic associated with it in the compiled help file nor will it display a topic when selected in the table
of contents.  It simply serves as a container for other topics and must have at least one child topic defined for
it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Title</p>
<ul>
<li>This is used as the title for empty container nodes.  For nodes with a file, the title is extracted
from the topic file at build time.  It can be set for informational purposes while editing the site map file.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Use as the default topic</p>
<ul>
<li>This will mark the selected topic as the default topic for the help file.  The default topic option
acts as a toggle.  Check it on a topic to set it as the default.  If another topic was previously marked as the
default topic, the option is removed from it.  Unchecking it on the same topic turns it off and no topic will be
selected as the default topic.  In such cases, the root namespaces page will be the default topic for the help
file.  When set, a green circle icon with a check mark appears next to the topic in the content layout tree to
indicate its status.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>This option only has an effect on Help 1, markdown, and website output.  MS Help Viewer does not
support site maps.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><p>API Content</p>
<ul>
<li>This is used to indicate how the API (reference) content for the help file should be inserted
relative to the selected topic.  The following options are available:</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>None</strong> - This topic will not be used as the API content insertion point.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Insert after this topic</strong> - The API content will be inserted immediately
after this topic in the table of contents.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This option acts as a toggle.  Select a value other than <strong>None</strong> to make it the
API content insertion point.  If another topic was previously marked as the API content insertion point, the
option is removed from it.  An icon will appear next to the topic in the content layout tree to indicate its
API content insertion point state.  This option can be combined with the default topic option.  If no topic is
set as the API content insertion point, the API content will be added to the table of contents following the
standard <a href="conceptcontent/contentplacement.html">content placement rules</a>.</p>
<p>The tool bar above the tree is used to perform various actions on the site map file such as adding
new topics, deleting topics, rearranging them, etc.  These options are also available in a context menu accessed
by right clicking on a topic in the tree.  The commands (from left to right) and their associated context menu
options perform the following actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add Sibling Topic
<ul>
<li>This will add a new topic at the same level as the currently selected topic.  The sub-options for this
command allow you to add a new topic file based on a template, add an existing topic file, add all topic files
from an existing folder, or add an empty container node.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>Adding a topic to the site map file will automatically add its related file to the project if
it is not already there.  Adding all files from a folder will add all topic files found recursively.  The folder
structure will be duplicated in the table of contents layout.</p>
<p>New files added to the project are added in the same location as the currently selected topic.  If
you want more precise control over file placement, add the new topics via the <strong>Project Explorer</strong> and then
use the <strong>Add Existing Topic File</strong> option to add them to the site map file.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><p>Add Child Topic</p>
<ul>
<li>This will add a new topic as a child of the currently selected topic.  The sub-options for this command
allow you to add a new topic file from a template, add an existing topic file, add all topic files from an
existing folder, or add an empty container node.  The notes from above for sibling topics apply to these commands
as well.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Delete</p>
<ul>
<li>Delete the selected topic and all of its sub-topics.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>Deleting a topic from the site map file will not delete its related file from the project.  Use
the <strong>Project Explorer</strong> to physically delete the file from the project and the file system.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><p>Copy as Topic Link</p>
<ul>
<li>Copy a link to the topic to the clipboard.  If pasted into an HTML file, an anchor link element is
inserted that will link to the selected topic.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Cut</p>
<ul>
<li>Cut the selected topic and its sub-topics to the clipboard.  A copy of the topic is made and it is then
removed from the tree.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Paste</p>
<ul>
<li>If a topic has been cut to the clipboard, you can click the <strong>Paste</strong> button to add it to the
tree.  If you just click the button, the topic is added as a sibling of the currently selected topic immediately
following it.  If you select the <strong>Paste as Child</strong> sub-option, the topic is inserted as a child of the
selected topic.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Edit File</p>
<ul>
<li>Edit the selected content file.  Double-clicking a topic in the tree will also open it for editing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Move Up</p>
<ul>
<li>This will move the selected topic up in the order of topics at the same level as the selected topic.
Note that moving a topic will also move its sub-topics.  Sub-topics will still remain in their given order below
the parent topic.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Move Down</p>
<ul>
<li>This will move the selected topic down in the order of topics at the same level as the selected topic.
Note that moving a topic will also move its sub-topics.  Sub-topics will still remain in their given order below
the parent topic.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Sort Topics</p>
<ul>
<li>Sort the topics alphabetically by title within the currently selected topic's group.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Expand/Collapse Options</p>
<ul>
<li>This command contains a set of options that lets you expand or collapse all topics in the tree or just
the sub-topics for the selected topic.  When the file is saved, the expanded/collapsed state is saved along with
the last selected topic making it easy to return to the spot you stopped editing the file when it was last
opened.  This information is also used by the <strong>Entity References Window</strong> to make it easy to find the
current topic when using it to insert topic references into other topic files.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Help</p>
<ul>
<li>Open this help topic in the help file.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Shortcuts"> Keyboard Shortcuts</h2>
<p>The following keyboard shortcuts can also be used in the content tree to execute the various commands:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Context Menu Key</strong> - Display the context menu.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Delete</strong> - Delete the selected topic.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Ctrl+Up</strong> - Move the selected topic up within its group.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Ctrl+Down</strong> - Move the selected topic down within its group.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Ctrl+C</strong> - Copy a link to the selected topic to the clipboard.  Performing a paste operation
in a text editor window will insert an anchor link to the copied topic.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Ctrl+X</strong> or <strong>Shift+Delete</strong> - Cut the selected topic to the clipboard.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Ctrl+V</strong> or <strong>Shift+Insert</strong> - Paste the topic on the clipboard as a sibling of the
selected topic.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Ctrl+Shift+V</strong> or <strong>Ctrl+Shift+Insert</strong> - Paste the topic on the clipboard as a child of
the selected topic.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Ctrl+E</strong> - Edit the selected topic.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Ctrl+Shift+T</strong> - Sort the topics at the same level as the selected topic alphabetically.</p>
</li>
