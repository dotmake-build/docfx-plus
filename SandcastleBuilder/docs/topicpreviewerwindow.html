<h1 id="topic-previewer-window">Topic Previewer Window</h1>

<p>When editing a conceptual content MAML topic, the help file builder allows you to quickly see how
your edits will look in the help file by previewing the topic in a separate window.  To do so in the standalone
GUI, select the <strong>Topic Previewer Window</strong> option on the <strong>Window</strong> menu, click the related main
toolbar button, or hit <strong>F5</strong>.  In Visual Studio, select the <strong>Topic Previewer Window</strong> option from
the <strong>View</strong> | <strong>Other Windows</strong> menu or the <strong>Other Windows</strong> toolbar button dropdown.</p>
<h2 id="PreviewTopic"> Topic Previewer Window</h2>
<p>The topic previewer window consists of a toolbar at the top, a table of contents tree view on the left,
and the rendered content for the selected topic on the right with the topic title above it.  The toolbar contains
options that let you navigate backwards and forwards through topics that you have viewed, refresh the content so
that it reflects any recent changes to the related token, content layout, and topic files, open the selected
topic in a file editor, expand or collapse the topics in the table of contents tree view, and open this help
topic.  The currently selected project filename is displayed to the right of the buttons.</p>
<p align="center">
<img alt="Topic Previewer" src="../images/TopicPreviewer.png">
</p>
<p>The tool window tracks the active project and will refresh the contents automatically if it detects
a change in the selected project (i.e. moving from one project to another in the Solution Explorer).  It will
also automatically refresh the content and display the active topic if you invoke the command to display the
previewer window while editing a topic.  In the event that current content is not displayed, click the <strong>Refresh</strong> button to force a reload of the current content.  The tool window takes into account all open
and unsaved token files, content layout files, and MAML topic files so there is no need to save anything before
opening the topic previewer.</p>
<p>Use the tree view on the left to navigate through the topics.  If the current topic contains links to
other MAML topics, you can click on them to immediately navigate to that topic.  Using the <strong>Browse Back</strong>
(Alt+Left) and <strong>Browse Forward</strong> (Alt+Right) options, you can navigate backwards and forwards through the
previously viewed topics.  Links to external content such as files and website URLs will be opened using the
default viewer for the given content (i.e. Internet Explorer for website URLs).</p>
<h2 id="Differences"> Differences Between Previewed and Built Topics</h2>
<p>The topic previewer does not perform a build on the project.  Instead, it renders the topics into a
flow document that resembles the built topic as closely as possible.  This process is extremely fast and lets you
make changes on the fly without having to save files or wait for a full or partial build of the project.  Since
it does not perform a build, you will notice some differences between the previewed topics and the built topics
as summarized below:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The topics are rendered in a style similar to the latest Visual Studio related presentation style.
However, except for the topic title, all other page header and footer elements will not appear nor will
additional elements such as logo images added to the topic using build components.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The spacing and font size on certain elements is slightly different but the overall appearance
should be close enough for you to get a good idea of how the topic will look in the resulting help file with
the presentation style applied.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Section headers are present but are not collapsible.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Flow documents do not size table columns the same way that HTML does.  By default, space is
distributed evenly across all columns rather than allotting more space to columns containing wider content.
To remedy this, the parser uses a simple algorithm to adjust the column widths based on the maximum width of the
content in each table cell across all rows.  While it does not result in an exact match to the table column
widths seen in the built topics, it is fairly close and should be fine for almost all cases.  You will see that
it wraps the text in shorter columns more often than the HTML layout but the column width differences are usually
minor.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Code entity reference links will appear as bold text in the rendered topic rather than links to
the referenced API member topic.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Code blocks will have leading whitespace and tab character spacing normalized and will be
colorized.  Line numbering is supported but collapsible sections are not.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If a code block imports code from an external file, the matching code will be imported if possible.
However, you may notice differences in the spacing due to the way the previewer treats whitespace ahead of the
code element.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Token replacement is supported.  However, if the token contains help file builder replacement tags,
they will be passed through to the topic as-is rather than being replaced with their project property value.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Elements that require specialized formatting handled by build components will be ignored.  Default
handling is supplied for certain elements such as <code>codeReference</code> that display the
attribute values or the content of the element.  All others are treated like unrecognized elements as described
below.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Unrecognized custom elements with inner text will be ignored but the inner text will be rendered in
the topic as normal text.  If an unrecognized inline element contains no inner text or child content, the element
name will be displayed within the content in bold text.  The parser will take a best guess as to whether it is
block or inline content based on the current context.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Any content in <code>markup</code> elements is passed through in its literal form.
Inline <code>markup</code> element content is rendered inline where it appears with a colored
background so that it is apparent that it is not standard inline content.  The content of block level <code>markup</code> elements are rendered in a style similar to a code block.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Sandcastle itself is quite forgiving when it comes to ill-formed topic content such as invalid
element placement and inline elements appearing where they should not.  The parser used by the previewer is not
as kind and will point out mistakes related to ill-formed documents with an error message appearing at the top
of the document in a red border.  If the error is caused by invalid XML such as a missing, misspelled, or
misplaced end element, the error message will point out the line and column where the error occurred.  For other
errors such as ill-formed content, the error will most likely refer to a missing or unexpected parent element for
a block or inline element.  The content that could be parsed will appear below the error to help you locate the
point at which the problem occurred.  Using Visual Studio with the MAML schemas installed will help identify
problems as the IntelliSense will point out invalid markup and help you correct it via the information in the
error tool tip.</p>
