<h1 id="build-failures">Build Failures</h1>

<p>This topic covers common questions and issues related to general build failures.</p>
<div class="TIP">
<h5>Tip</h5>
<p>Most build failures contain an error number such as BE0065.  See the <a href="../errorsandwarnings/errorsandwarnings.html">Errors and Warnings</a> topic to locate the error or warning number for more
details about its cause and possible solutions.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="BuildTools"> Why does the build fail telling me that it cannot find the Sandcastle or help compiler tools?</h2>
<p>First and foremost, be sure that you have installed the latest version of the help file builder and
any required help compiler(s).  The help compilers are not part of the help file builder and must be downloaded
and installed separately.  See the <a href="../gettingstarted/installation.html">Installation Instructions</a> topic for
information on where to download the required tools.  If you have the tools installed, but in a non-standard
location, you may need to specify the paths to the tools.  See the <a href="../propertieswindow/pathprops.html">Paths Category Properties</a> topic for more information.</p>
<h2 id="MissingDLL"> Why does my build fail with an error saying that it cannot find an assembly?</h2>
<p>When you added documentation sources to the project, you may have specified the wrong name or
perhaps chose the assembly from the wrong folder (i.e. <em>.\Debug</em> instead of <em>.\Release</em>).  Check the assembly path and filename and verify that it does exist.  If the
path is correct, make sure the assembly actually exists.  Rebuild your project if necessary to recreate it.</p>
<p>If using a solution or project as the documentation source, be sure that the configuration and
platform settings are correct and that the assemblies exist for the given combination of configuration and
platform.  Check both the global settings and, if necessary the documentation source settings to find out what
configuration and platform are expected.  The build log may also indicate which configuration and platform where
found and used.</p>
<h2 id="UnresolvedAssembly"> Why does my build fail with an &quot;Unresolved assembly reference&quot; error?</h2>
<p>If the build fails in the <strong>Generating reflection information</strong> step with an
error that starts &quot; <strong>Error: Unresolved assembly reference</strong> &quot;, you need to add the named
assembly as a reference.  This is done by adding a reference to it in the <code>References</code>
node in the Project Explorer window.  See the <a href="../projectexplorer/references.html">References</a> topic
for more information on adding reference items.</p>
<p>Another common cause of this error is not setting the project's <strong>Framework Version</strong> property
correctly.  For example, you may have left it set to .NET Framework 4.5 but you are actually documenting a .NET
Portable or Silverlight framework assembly.  You can typically tell if this is the case as the version number in
the error message will not match the framework version in the project.  Correcting the project framework version
should resolve the issue.  Using a Visual Studio solution or project as the documentation source is recommended
as the help file builder will figure out the framework version and references automatically based on the project
settings.</p>
<p>In some cases, the documented assembly may reference an assembly with a version that is different
than the one you have or may reference an assembly that you do not have.  In such cases the <a href="../plugins/assemblybindingredirection.html">Assembly Binding Redirection Plug-In</a> can be added to the project to resolve these issues.
See the referenced topic for more information.</p>
<h2 id="AutoResolve"> Why can't Sandcastle resolve all dependent assembly references automatically?</h2>
<p>Sandcastle, specifically <strong>MRefBuilder</strong>, uses CCI (Common Compiler
Infrastructure) for assembly reflection.  CCI searches the current directory for dependent assemblies as well as
any directories specified by the <em>/dep</em> (Dependencies) command line option.  CCI does not
attempt to open a dependent assembly until some information from that assembly is needed. CCI is used because
technically, CCI never &quot;loads&quot; any assembly; it just parses the data in the assembly file.  That is why CCI can
reflect over a foreign <code>mscorlib</code> while <code>System.Reflection</code> cannot.
This allows Sandcastle to be used for documenting assemblies built with any version of the .NET Framework.  CCI
is also used by <strong>FxCop</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="LockedAssembly"> After building a help file, I cannot rebuild the projects for the documented assemblies due to anerror that says they are already in use by another process.  Why?</h2>
<p>The build engine searches the project folder and all subfolders as well as the project's
Component Path property folder if specified for Managed Extensibility Framework (MEF) components that can be used
for build components, plug-ins, syntax generators, and presentation styles.  Unfortunately, MEF does not unload
assemblies that it does not need.  If your documented assemblies are in a subfolder below where the help file
builder project is stored or the specified Component Path location, they will be loaded during the component
search and will not be released until you close Visual Studio or the standalone GUI.</p>
<p>The solution is simple.  Move the help file builder project to its own sub-folder so that it
does not get to search the folders containing the assemblies being documented.  If using the Component Path
property to specify a location to search for components, place them in a sub-folder or another location so that
it will not find the documented assemblies as well.</p>
<h2 id="NoAPIs"> Why does my build fail with an error saying &quot;No APIs found to document&quot;?</h2>
<p>Classes need to be declared public in your code, you need to enable the <strong>Document Privates</strong>
and/or <strong>Document Internals</strong> project property so that Sandcastle documents the internal/private members, or
you need to include at least one assembly and at least one namespace to document.  There should be at least one
assembly, solution, or project file listed in the <strong>Documentation Sources</strong> node in the Project Explorer
window.  Use the <strong>Namespaces Summaries</strong> or <strong>API Filter</strong> project property editor to be sure that
you have at least one valid item that is checked and thus included.  If you are using the API Filter property,
check it to make sure you have not accidentally excluded everything.</p>
<h2 id="OrcasNamer"> Why does my build fail in MRefBuilder with a NullReferenceException related to OrcasNamer.WriteType?</h2>
<p>The most likely cause of this problem is that you have the project's <strong>Framework Version</strong>
property set to .NET 1.0 or .NET 1.1 but you are trying to document a .NET 2.0 or later assembly.  Check the
property to make sure that it is set appropriately for your assembly.</p>
<h2 id="OutOfMemory"> I'm getting an Out of Memory exception during a very large build.  How do I prevent it?</h2>
<p>When performing a build that generates an extremely large amount of output, you may encounter an <code>OutOfMemoryException</code> if verbose logging is enabled in the help file builder GUI.  If
this occurs, turn off the <strong>Build window verbose logging enabled</strong> option in the user preferences.  Full
details are still written to the log file and can be viewed after the build.</p>
<p>If the error persists, you may be trying to document too many assemblies or one that contains an
extremely large number of namespaces and/or types.  The only solution in this case is to break up the project
so that it documents fewer namespaces and/or types thus reducing the amount of memory required.  If you are
building the help on a 32-bit system, switching to a 64-bit system with more memory may allow the build to
complete.</p>
<p>If the Help 1 compiler fails due to an out of memory condition, it is doubtful that there is much
that can be done.  Since it’s a 32-bit process, the Help 1 compiler won’t use more memory than the maximum
addressable by a 32-bit process (somewhere between 2GB and 4GB depending on various factors).  Switching to an
alternate output format such as MS Help Viewer or breaking the project up into smaller parts are probably the
only solutions for it.</p>
<h2 id="ConceptualOnly"> I want to create a help file without an assembly.  When I try to build the help file, it fails andtells me I need at least one documentation source.  Why?</h2>
<p>Sandcastle was designed to document code based on a set of XML comments and API information found
in a reflection information file.  As such, it requires at least one assembly in order to produce a help file
containing API documentation.  If you do not include at least one assembly with a namespace containing at least
one public class, the help file cannot be produced.</p>
<p>However, you can use the <a href="../plugins/addcontentplugin.html">Additional Content Only Plug-In</a> to produce a
help file based on conceptual content alone.  To do so, add the plug-in to the project via the <strong>Plug-Ins</strong>
project property category, add conceptual content to the project, and build the help file.  See the <a href="../addconceptcontent/conceptcontent/conceptcontent.html">Conceptual Content</a> topic for more information about how to utilize
conceptual content.</p>
