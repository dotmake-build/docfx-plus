<h1 id="api-filter-property">API Filter Property</h1>

<p>The API Filter editor provides a form used to choose the API topics that will appear in the help
file. It allows you to include or exclude namespaces, types, and members from the documented assemblies as well
as those from inherited .NET Framework and third-party dependency assemblies.  To access it, select the <code>Visibility</code> category of project properties and click the <strong>Edit API Filter</strong> button.
When clicked, the following dialog box appears.</p>
<p align="center">
<img alt="API Filter" src="../../images/ApiFilter.png">
</p>
<h2 id="APITree"> The API Tree</h2>
<p>When first opened, there is a slight delay as a partial build of the project is performed in order to
generate a list of the API members that can appear in the help file.  A tree view containing the API members
appears on the left side of the dialog.  The tree contains two root nodes. The first, <strong>Documented APIs</strong>,
contains all members from the documented assemblies that can appear in the help file.  This list is based on the
current project settings.  Members excluded by the other <code>Document*</code> project properties in
the <strong>Visibility</strong> category will not appear here.  The second root node, <strong>Inherited APIs</strong>, lists the base classes from which the documented APIs inherit.  This list will include
classes from the base .NET Framework and other third-party dependency assemblies.  Information from these classes
will appear on the member list pages for each of the documented classes.  By unchecking items in this set of
classes, you can remove unwanted members that may otherwise clutter the member list pages.</p>
<p>You will notice that some tree nodes are in <em>italic</em> text.  This indicates
that the node cannot be unchecked by you.  Hovering the mouse over the node will show a tool tip describing why it
cannot be unchecked.  The reasons include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It is one of the two root nodes.  These are general containers and cannot be unchecked.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It is a namespace that contains a set of inherited types from the .NET Framework or a dependency
assembly.  These namespaces will not be represented in the help file.  You may exclude individual inherited
classes from the namespace as well as inherited class members to control what information appears in a documented
class's member list page.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A namespace is excluded via the <a href="namespacesummaries.html">NamespaceSummaries</a> property or an item is excluded because its XML comments include an <code>&lt;exclude /&gt;</code>
tag.  This information is merged automatically with the API filter settings.  To alter these items, you will need
to use the <code>Namespace Summaries</code> property or remove the tag from the item's XML comments.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>An icon appears next to each node that provides information about what it represents and its visibility.
These icons correspond to the search options in the upper right side of the dialog.  Public members show the
basic icons from Namespaces through Fields.  Protected, internal, and private members will show a combination of
the basic icon plus the appropriate visibility icon.  The names of the items will appear as they do in the help
file.  One difference is that parameter information and any overloaded members are not listed.  This is because
the API filter only goes by name.  Parameter information is not used.  As such, if one overloaded member is
excluded, all overloaded members are excluded.</p>
<h2 id="IncludeExclude"> Including and Excluding Members</h2>
<p>All checked items will appear in the help file.  To exclude an item, simply uncheck it.  Checking or
unchecking a namespace or type will automatically check or uncheck all of its nested members as well.  On a
similar note, if you uncheck a majority of the members of a namespace or type, you may notice that the parent
node is also unchecked and changes color.  Checking a majority of the members will cause the parent node to also
become checked and resets the background color.  This behavior is normal and is done to produce a more efficient
API filter.  The different color helps identify namespaces and types in which not all child members are excluded.</p>
<h2 id="Search"> Searching for Members</h2>
<p>The search options appear in the upper right side of the dialog.  To search for an item, simply type
some text in the search text box, set the filter options as needed, and click the <strong>Find</strong> button.  The
search results will appear in the list view below the options.  The <strong>Members Found</strong> column lists the name
as it will appear in the help file.  The <strong>Full Name</strong> column lists the item's full name including the
namespace and type information.  The items are grouped by namespace and type in alphabetical order.  Documented
API matches are listed first followed by matches from the inherited APIs.  The search text can be as simple as a
fragment of a member name or it can be a regular expression used to find more complex patterns.  See <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/9099/The-30-Minute-Regex-Tutorial">The 30 Minute Regex Tutorial</a> for a brief introduction to regular expressions and how to use
them.  See the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/base-types/regular-expressions">.NET Framework Regular Expressions</a> help topic for complete details about the various regular
expression elements and options.  A few simple search examples are show in the table below.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Search Expression</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>project</td>
<td>Find members containing the text &quot;project&quot;.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>^To</td>
<td>Find members starting with &quot;To&quot;.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>\d$</td>
<td>Find members ending with a digit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>s{2}$</td>
<td>Find members ending with two occurrences of the letter &quot;s&quot; (and/or uppercase &quot;S&quot; as well if<br>case-insensitive).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>File(Path|Folder)</td>
<td>Find members containing &quot;File&quot; followed by either &quot;Path&quot; or &quot;Folder&quot;.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>^FilePath$</td>
<td>Find members named &quot;FilePath&quot; exactly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Sandcastle.Core.*Project</td>
<td>Find any member in a namespace starting with &quot;Sandcastle.Core&quot; containing the text<br>&quot;Project&quot; (when the &quot;Fully-qualified&quot; option is enabled).</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>In the absence of any regular expression operators, the search will return all members containing the
specified text as shown in the first example.</p>
<h2 id="SearchOpts"> The Search Options</h2>
<p>The following options affect how the search is performed and the results that it will return.  By
default, the searches are case-insensitive, only search the member names as displayed in the tree view, and
include members of all types and visibility in the results.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Option</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Case-sensitive</td>
<td>Check this box to make the searches case-sensitive.  By default, searches are case-insensitive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Fully-qualified</td>
<td>By default, searches only match text in the member name displayed in the tree view.  By checking<br>this option, you can search the fully-qualified names instead (full namespace, type, and member name).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Namespaces</td>
<td>Include namespaces in the search results.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Classes</td>
<td>Include classes in the search results.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Structures</td>
<td>Include structures in the search results.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Interfaces</td>
<td>Include interfaces in the search results.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Enumerations</td>
<td>Include enumerations in the search results.  Note that you can search for enumerations by name or<br>for members of the enumerated type.  The individual members of the enumerated type are classed as fields and do<br>not appear in the tree though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Delegates</td>
<td>Include delegates in the search results.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Constructors</td>
<td>Include constructors in the search results.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Methods</td>
<td>Include methods in the search results.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Operators</td>
<td>Include operators in the search results (i.e. Equality, Inequality, GreaterThan, etc.).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Properties</td>
<td>Include properties in the search results.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Events</td>
<td>Include events in the search results.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Fields</td>
<td>Include fields in the search results.  The individual members of enumerated types are included in<br>this category as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Public</td>
<td>Include public members in the search results.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Protected</td>
<td>Include protected members in the search results.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Internal</td>
<td>Include internal members in the search results.  These will only be present if the <code>Document Internals</code> project property is enabled.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Private</td>
<td>Include private members in the search results.  These will only be present if the <code>Document Privates</code> project property is enabled.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Double-clicking on a member in the search results or clicking the <strong>Goto</strong> button below the list
will take you to the selected member in the tree view.  You can select multiple members in the search results by
clicking and dragging the mouse or by using the keyboard.  Clicking <strong>Include</strong> or <strong>Exclude</strong> will
include (check) or exclude (uncheck) all of the currently selected members in the search results.  To clear the
API filter and set it back to its default state, click the <strong>Reset</strong> button.</p>
