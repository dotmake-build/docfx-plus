<h1 id="visibility-category-properties">Visibility Category Properties</h1>

<p>The following properties are available in the Visibility category.  These control what appears in the
help file and can reduce the help content and get rid of unwanted items, especially when documenting internal and
private members.</p>
<h2 id="DocAttrs"> Attributes on types and their members (DocumentAttributes)</h2>
<p>When set to false, the default, the help file builder will strip all attribute information from the
documented items so that they do not appear in the syntax section of each class, property, method, etc. in the
compiled help file. When set to true, the attribute information is left intact and will appear in the help file.
Several attributes such as <code>ExtensionAttribute</code>, <code>FixedBufferAttribute</code>, <code>FlagsAttribute</code>, <code>SerializableAttribute</code>, <code>ObsoleteAttribute</code> are always included regardless of this property's setting as they provide
important information about the types and members to which they are applied or are used by other components such
as the syntax generators or presentation style transformations.</p>
<h2 id="DocEII"> Explicit interface implementations (DocumentExplicitInterfaceImplementations)</h2>
<p>When set to false, the default, explicit interface implementations are removed from the help file.
This includes explicit implementations in base classes so that they do not appear in the class members help
pages.  Set this property to true to include them in the help file.</p>
<h2 id="DocInhMem"> Inherited base class members (DocumentInheritedMembers)</h2>
<p>When set to true, the default, all inherited members of the class are listed in the class members help
page.  When set to false, all inherited members including inherited .NET Framework class members are removed from
the class members help pages.  This can be useful when documenting internal or private members to help reduce
clutter.</p>
<h2 id="DocFrmwkMem"> Inherited .NET Framework members (DocumentInheritedFrameworkMembers)</h2>
<p>When set to true, the default, all inherited .NET Framework members of the class (any members starting
with &quot; <code>System.</code> &quot; or &quot; <code>Microsoft.</code> &quot;) are listed in the class members
help pages. When set to false, all inherited .NET Framework class members are removed from the class members help
pages.  This can be useful when documenting internal or private members to help reduce clutter.  For this option
to work, <code>Document Inherited Members</code> must also be set to true.  When it is set to false,
all framework members are removed.</p>
<h2 id="DocFrmwkInt"> Inherited .NET Framework internal members (DocumentInheritedFrameworkInternalMembers)</h2>
<p>When set to false, the default, all inherited .NET Framework members that have internal (Friend)
visibility (any internal members starting with &quot; <code>System.</code> &quot; or &quot; <code>Microsoft.</code> &quot;)
are removed from the class members help pages.  This can be useful when documenting internal or private members
to help reduce clutter.  For this option to work, <code>Document Inherited Framework Members</code>
and <code>Document Internals</code> must also be set to true. When this property is set to true,
internal framework members are included.</p>
<h2 id="DocFrmwkPriv"> Inherited .NET Framework private members (DocumentInheritedFrameworkPrivateMembers)</h2>
<p>When set to false, the default, all inherited .NET Framework members that have private visibility (any
private members starting with &quot; <code>System.</code> &quot; or &quot; <code>Microsoft.</code> &quot;) are
removed from the class members help pages.  This can be useful when documenting internal or private members to
help reduce clutter.  For this option to work, <code>Document Inherited Framework Members</code> and <code>Document Privates</code> must also be set to true.  When this property is set to true, private
framework members are included.</p>
<h2 id="DocInternals"> Internal members (DocumentInternals)</h2>
<p>When set to false, the default, the help file builder will not document any internal (Friend) members
in the documentation assemblies.  Because they share a similar visibility, protected internal members will be
left in the help file when this is set to true even if the <code>Document Protected</code> property
is set to false. Also note that this property works independently of the <code>Document Privates</code>
property below.</p>
<h2 id="DocPrvFlds"> Private fields (DocumentPrivateFields)</h2>
<p>When set to false, the default, the help file builder will not document any private fields in the
documentation assemblies.  Since most private fields back properties or represent items such as controls on
forms, they usually do not have comments and can significantly clutter the resulting help file with unwanted
entries.  Leaving this option set to false can eliminate the problem.  When set to true, the private fields are
included in  the help file.  To work, the <code>Document Privates</code> property must also be set
to true.</p>
<h2 id="DocPrivates"> Private members (DocumentPrivates)</h2>
<p>When set to false, the default, the help file builder will not document any private members in the
documentation assemblies.  Note that this property works independently of the <code>Document Internals</code>
property above.</p>
<h2 id="DocProt"> Protected members (DocumentProtected)</h2>
<p>When set to true, the default, the help file builder will document all protected and protected internal
members in the documentation assemblies.  When false, the help file builder will remove them from the help file
including those inherited from base .NET framework classes (those starting with &quot; <code>System.</code> &quot;
and &quot; <code>Microsoft.</code> &quot;).  Because they share a similar visibility, protected internal members
will be left in the help file when the <code>Document Internals</code> property is set to true even
if this property is set to false.</p>
<h2 id="DocSealed"> Protected members of sealed classes (DocumentSealedProtected)</h2>
<p>When set to false, the default, the help file builder will remove all protected members from sealed
classes so that they do not appear in the help file.  When true, the help file builder will document all
protected members of sealed classes in the documentation assemblies.  To work, the <code>Document Protected</code>
property must also be set to true.</p>
<h2 id="NoPIATypes"> No-PIA (Primary Interop Assembly) embedded interop types (DocumentNoPIATypes)</h2>
<p>When set to false, the default, the help file builder will remove all &quot;no-PIA&quot; embedded interop types
(those marked as compiler generated with a type identifier attribute).  When true, such types are documented.
Examples of these types are the Microsoft Office reference assemblies used in Office add-in projects.</p>
<h2 id="PubCompGen"> Public compiler generated types and members (DocumentPublicCompilerGenerated)</h2>
<p>When set to false, the default, the help file builder will remove all compiler generated types and
members from the help file.  This is usually the desired behavior as compiler generated types are typically
internal constructs that are not wanted in the help file.  However, in some cases, the compiler generated types
may be wanted such as for compiler generated resource classes or data access classes.  When true, such types and
members are included but only if they are public.  Any private, internal, and protected compiler generated types
and members will still be removed.</p>
<h2 id="EditorBrowsableNever"> Types and members marked with an EditorBrowsable attribute set to Never (DocumentEditorBrowsableNever)</h2>
<p>When set to false, the default, the help file builder will exclude all types and members marked with
an <a class="xref" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.componentmodel.editorbrowsableattribute">EditorBrowsableAttribute</a>
set to <code>Never</code>.  If set to true, they are included.  Types and members must be explicitly
marked with the attribute to be excluded.  Types derived from excluded types and overridden members that are not
explicitly marked again will be included.  This mimics the behavior of the Object Browser tool window in Visual
Studio.</p>
<h2 id="NonBrowsable"> Types and members marked with a Browsable attribute set to False (DocumentNonBrowsable)</h2>
<p>When set to false, the help file builder will exclude all types and members marked with
a <a class="xref" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.componentmodel.browsableattribute">BrowsableAttribute</a>
set to <code>False</code>.  If set to true, the default, they are included.  Types and members must
be explicitly marked with the attribute to be excluded.  Types derived from excluded types and overridden members
that are not explicitly marked again will be included.  This mimics the behavior of the Object Browser tool
window in Visual Studio.</p>
<h2 id="InternalAndPrivateIfExternal"> Internal members in other assemblies and private members of base types (DocumentInternalAndPrivateIfExternal)</h2>
<p>When set to false, the default, the help file builder will exclude internal members from base types
in other assemblies and private members from base types.  If set to true, those members are included if the related
internal and private member options are also enabled.  This does not affect internal and private members inherited
from base framework types.  Those are included or excluded based on the related options described above.</p>
<h2 id="DocProtInt"> Document &quot;protected internal&quot; members as &quot;protected&quot; instead (DocumentProtectedInternalAsProtected)</h2>
<p>When set to true, the default, the help file builder will alter protected internal members so that
they are listed as protected only in the help file.  When true, the help file builder will document all protected
internal members of classes in the documentation assemblies without modification.  If <code>DocumentProtected</code> is set to false, this option is ignored.</p>
<h2 id="ExtMethods"> Include extension methods in member list topics (IncludeExtensionMethodsInMemberLists)</h2>
<p>When set to true, the default, the help file builder will include an extension methods section in
member list topics for types to which the extension methods apply.  If set to false, the extension methods
section in member list topics is omitted and extension methods will only appear within their containing type
documentation topics.</p>
<h2 id="ObjExtMethods"> Include extension methods that extend System.Object (IncludeObjectExtensionMethodsInMemberLists)</h2>
<p>When set to true, the default, the help file builder will include extension methods that extend <code>System.Object</code> in the extension methods section in member list topics for all types.  If
set to false, those extension methods will be omitted from member list topics and will only appear within their
containing type documentation topics.  This is useful if you find that such methods are not useful to all types
within your documentation and prefer to leave them out.  They are automatically omitted from enumerated types as
such general extension methods typically serve no useful purpose if listed for enumerations.  If the main
extension methods option above is set to false, this option will have no effect.</p>
<h2 id="ApiFilter"> Edit API Filter (ApiFilter)</h2>
<p>This property represents a collection of items that define an API filter for the <strong>MRefBuilder</strong> tool.  The items in this filter define which elements of a namespace or
type should be omitted from the generated reflection information file and thus the resulting help file.  This is
useful for excluding unwanted types and members, especially those generated by the compiler, and inherited base
class members.  Namespaces excluded in the <code>Namespace Summaries</code> property and items
containing an <code>&lt;exclude /&gt;</code> tag in their XML comments are automatically added to the
API filter at build time.  If there is a conflict between these items and the API filter, the API filter will
take precedence and a warning is written to the log file to note the conflict. See the <a href="apifilter.html">API Filter Property</a> topic for more details on how to use this property.</p>
