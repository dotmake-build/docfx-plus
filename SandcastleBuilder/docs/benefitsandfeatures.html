<h1 id="benefits-and-features">Benefits and Features</h1>

<p>This help file was built using the help file builder and demonstrates many of the features that it
provides as described in the following sections:</p>
<h2 id="General"> General Benefits and Features</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>The standalone GUI interface provides a Visual Studio-like project explorer and a set of
property pages that let you manage the project settings and edit the files associated with the project.  If you
are familiar with Visual Studio or third-party integrated development environments like SharpDevelop, you should
be able to get up and running fairly quickly.  You do not need to know anything about the underlying Sandcastle
tools to take advantage of their features.</p>
</li>
<li><p>An extension package is available for VisualStudioMinVersionand later that lets
you create, manage, and build projects from within Visual Studio.  In addition to providing a familiar
environment for project management, it also gives you access to the additional features provided by Visual Studio
such as source control for your help file projects.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The help file builder can produce an HTML Help 1 (.chm) file, an MS Help Viewer (.mshc) file,
an Open XML (.docx) document, a website, and/or markdown content.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The MS Help Viewer output includes a valid help content setup file that can be used to install
the content in the help viewer using the Help Library Manager tool.  Options are included in the standalone GUI
and the Visual Studio package to install and view the content without having to perform those tasks manually.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A Help Library Manager launcher utility is also supplied to ease installation and removal of
MS Help Viewer content.  This utility is freely distributable for use with your product installers.  Sample
scripts are generated with the help file that show how to use the tool to install and remove the content.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The website output contains a standard HTML index page.  The table of content style varies by
presentation style.  Older versions use a frame-based layout while newer presentation styles use table of
contents elements embedded in each topic.  The new style is implemented as HTML and client-side script which is
suitable for servers and content delivery networks that do not support ASP.NET or PHP.  A full-text index search
feature is available as well with support for ASP.NET, PHP, and client-side script implementations.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The project settings are saved in a standard MSBuild-format project file and can be built from
within the standalone GUI, from the command line using <strong>MSBuild</strong> or <strong>dotnetbuild</strong>, or in a post-build step for a Visual Studio project that runs <strong>MSBuild</strong>.
Support for full Visual Studio integration is also available with the above mentioned extension package.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Visual Studio 2005 and later solution and project files are supported directly as documentation
sources.  When the help project is built, the assembly, XML comments file, and reference information is imported
from them and used automatically.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In addition, both executable (<em>.EXE</em>) and library (<em>.DLL</em>)
assemblies can be added individually as documentation sources along with any related XML comments files.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Dependency references can also be specified individually.  File, GAC, project, and COM
references are supported.  COM references are supported in the project file but can only be added natively via
the Visual Studio extension package.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The help file builder will automatically locate both Sandcastle and the help compilers by
looking at the common environment variables, in the system path, and in the Program Files special folder on all
fixed hard drives.  Properties are also supplied for you to specify the paths on the off-chance that it cannot
locate them automatically.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The build process provides full logging and error handling.  All output from the build is stored
in a log file in the output folder.  The log is in an XML format and can be ran through an XSL transformation to
make it more readable, to highlight warnings and errors, etc.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The intermediate files used to create the help file are placed in a working folder beneath an
output folder of your choosing.  They can be automatically removed after a successful build or kept around for
further modifications.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Most of the NDoc features have been built into the Sandcastle Help File Builder including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Definition of project summary and namespace summary comments that will appear in the help
file.  You can also easily indicate which namespaces to include or exclude from the help file.  Support is also
included for specifying namespace comments via a <code>NamespaceDoc</code> class within each
namespace.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The ability to turn off documentation of attributes and various other unwanted API
elements.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Automatic determination of the default topic for the help file.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You have control over the help file name, title, header text, and footer information such
as the e-mail address, copyright text, and copyright URL.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Support for conceptual content is fully integrated.  This allows you to define additional
content	that appears in the table of contents such as usage notes, tutorials, etc.  Conceptual content is created
using Microsoft Assistance Markup Language (MAML).</p>
</li>
<li><p>For backward compatibility, standard HTML files can also be included and merged with the table
of contents using a site map file to define their layout.  However, note that these features have been deprecated
and MAML is the preferred method of adding conceptual content to the help files.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Language selection and localization support is built in.  Translations are provided for the help
file builder resource files in several languages and information is provided on how to localize the <a href="langres.html">Sandcastle content files</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Support is included for the <code>&lt;inheritdoc /&gt;</code> tag which allows you
to inherit documentation from base types/members.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="PlugIns"> Extensibility Using Plug-Ins</h2>
<p>Steps have been taken to make the build process more open so that you have a chance to customize
it without having to modify the code for the build engine itself or the Sandcastle tools.  Custom build process
plug-ins are supported that can be used to extend or alter the build process in various ways.  Plug-ins supplied
with the help file builder include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Additional Content Only - Build help files based on nothing but the conceptual and/or
additional content items in a project (no API content).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Additional Reference Links - Add additional sources of reference links for third-party
libraries or online content that does not appear in your help file.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Completion Notification - E-mail the build results to someone, optionally attaching the log
file (raw or transformed via XSL).</p>
</li>
<li><p>DBCS Fix for CHM Builds - Fixes the HTML content and runs the Help 1 compiler in the proper
locale to overcome its encoding issues when using non-English languages that use a double-byte character set
(DBCS).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Output Deployment - Copy the resulting help file to a file share, web server, FTP site,
etc.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Table of Contents Exclusion - Used to exclude API members from the table of contents (the
members still appear in the help file).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Version Builder - Generate version information for the current project and others related to
the same product and merge that information into a single help file for all of them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The plug-in interface is public and is <a href="customcomponents/createplugins.html">documented</a>
in this help file allowing you to create your own custom plug-ins.</p>
<h2 id="BuildComponents"> Extensibility Using Build Components</h2>
<p>Build components can be used to extend or alter how the topics are created at build time.  This
lets you add new features such as code colorization or support for visual elements specific to a particular help
file format.  The help file builder supplies the following custom build components:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A code block component that extends the <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> XML comment tag
with file inclusion, syntax highlighting, line numbering, collapsible <code>#region</code> and <code>#if/#else/#endif</code> sections.  This is usable in both reference and conceptual content.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A &quot;show missing&quot; component that adds &quot;missing&quot; notes for missing <code>summary</code>, <code>returns</code>, <code>param</code>, <code>value</code>, and <code>remarks</code> documentation tags and that can also auto-document certain compiler generated
elements such as default constructors and finalizers.</p>
</li>
<li><p>An IntelliSense component used to extract the XML comments into files that can be used for
IntelliSense.  Only the basic set of tags needed for IntelliSense are exported and only for documented API
members.  This can greatly reduce the size of the IntelliSense files and removes all private implementation
details when only documenting the public API.</p>
</li>
<li><p>An API token resolution component that lets you utilize MAML tokens in your XML comments to
insert common elements or sections of documentation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All build components are Managed Extensibility Framework (MEF) components and can be selected for
inclusion in your projects.  You can also create your own components using the <a href="customcomponents/createbuildcomponent.html">documenation</a> in this help file.  There is also
support for defining additional <a href="customcomponents/createsyntaxfilter.html">language syntax generators</a>
used to generate the syntax sections in the API reference topics.</p>
<h2 id="PresentationStyles"> Support for Third-Party Presentation Styles</h2>
<p>Sandcastle comes with some standard presentation styles.  You can use them as-is or clone them to
make modifications to suit your needs.  You can also create brand new presentation styles.  As with plug-ins and
build components, the help file builder allows you to create additional presentation styles that it can use by
creating new Managed Extensibility Framework (MEF) components that describes the various parts and how to use
them.  When found, these additional presentation styles are made available to you in the project's property
pages.</p>
