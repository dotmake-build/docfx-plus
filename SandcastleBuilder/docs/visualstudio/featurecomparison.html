<h1 id="feature-comparison-and-location">Feature Comparison and Location</h1>

<p>This topic compares the features available in the standalone GUI and the Visual Studio extension
package.  It provides information on where to find the comparable feature in Visual Studio as well as notes
on differences between the two.</p>
<h2 id="UserPrefs"> User Preferences</h2>
<p>User preferences related to general options that are not tied to any specific project can be found
in the Visual Studio options dialog box.  Select <strong>Tools</strong> | <strong>Options</strong> from the main menu bar and
then select the <strong>Sandcastle Help File Builder</strong> category.  The available user preferences differ
slightly between the standalone GUI and Visual Studio.  For a more detailed description of the available
preference options, see the <a href="../gettingstarted/userprefs.html">User Preferences</a> topic.</p>
<h2 id="NewProject"> Creating a New Project</h2>
<p>To create a new help file builder project within Visual Studio, do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Select <strong>File</strong> | <strong>New</strong> | <strong>Project</strong> from the main menu bar.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the <strong>New Project</strong> dialog, select the <strong>Documentation</strong> sub-category.  If you cannot
see the help file build project template, ensure that you have selected the &quot;All Languages&quot; and &quot;All Platforms&quot;
options as well rather than a specific language or platform.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Select the <strong>Sandcastle Help File Builder Project</strong> template to create a new, blank project.
Enter a new project name, the folder in which to place it, and any other options, and then click the <strong>Create</strong>
button to create it.</p>
</li>
</ol>

</p>
<h2 id="ProjectManagement"> Project Management</h2>
<p>The Visual Studio shell takes the place of the standalone GUI for all project management related tasks
such as creating projects, adding and removing files to them, and building them.  There are many additional
benefits to using Visual Studio for help file builder projects such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Help file projects are part of a Visual Studio solution file and can be combined and built
along with other project types such as the assembly projects that they are documenting.  As such, there is no
longer a need to build the help file project using the post-build event of another project.  You can also
combine multiple help file projects into a single solution file.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The <strong>Solution Explorer</strong> tool window supports multiple selection and you can perform
operations on more than one file at once.</p>
</li>
<li><p>With the projects hosted in Visual Studio, you gain access to source control and can
manage help file builder projects under source control much more easily.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Visual Studio provides better editors for all of the common file types.  In addition, you gain
access to extra features when editing files such as IntelliSense.  The package installs schemas for Microsoft
Assistance Markup Language (MAML) topic files to make editing them easier.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Additional add-ins and extensions can be installed to provide new features such as
spell checking, etc.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The equivalent project management features and commands from the standalone GUI should be quite easy
to find within Visual Studio.  Opening existing projects, managing files within a project, building a project, and
cleaning the project output, is done the same way as for any other type of Visual Studio project.  The <strong>SolutionExplorer</strong> tool window in Visual Studio corresponds to the <strong>Project Explorer</strong> tool window in the standalone
GUI and provides all of the same options with regard to adding and removing documentation sources, references, and
other supporting files.  Properties for project items are edited via the <strong>Properties</strong> tool window in Visual
Studio.  An additional <strong>Project Properties</strong> node appears in the Visual Studio solution explorer that lets you
open the project property editor window.  You can also get to it by right clicking on the project node and selecting
the <strong>Properties</strong> context menu option.  The <strong>Open Project in Standalone GUI</strong> option on the project node's
context menu will allow you to open the selected project in the standalone GUI.  The <strong>View Build Log Content</strong>
option on the context menu will allow you to open the <strong>Build Log Content</strong> tool window.  It displays the full
content of the build log from the last time the help file project was built.</p>
<h2 id="ProjectProps"> Editing a Project's Properties</h2>
<p>The project properties can be accessed by selecting the <strong>Properties</strong> context menu option on the
project node or by double-clicking the <strong>Project Properties</strong> node in the <strong>Solution Explorer</strong> tool
window.  The project properties editor window in Visual Studio is almost identical to the one in the standalone
GUI.  Properties are grouped into categories sorted by frequency of usage rather than alphabetically.  On each
property page, an information and/or warning tip icon appears after some properties.  Hover the mouse over the
icon to see additional usage notes or warnings related to the property.</p>
<p align="center">
<img alt="Visual Studio project properties editor" src="../../images/VSProjectPropsEditor.png">
</p>
<h2 id="SHFBToolbar"> Menu Option and Toolbar Locations</h2>
<p>A toolbar is available for help file builder projects.  On it, you will find the options to open the
various help file formats, open the MS Help Viewer library manager tool, open the build log content tool window,
open the FAQ help topic, and open the help file builder's help file.  The help file viewing options are also
available from the <strong>View</strong> | <strong>View Help File</strong> submenu.  To show or hide the help file builder toolbar,
either select the <strong>View</strong> | <strong>Toolbars</strong> | <strong>Sandcastle Help File Builder</strong> menu option or right
click in the toolbar area and select the <strong>Sandcastle Help File Builder</strong> context menu option.</p>
<p>The <strong>Entity References</strong> tool window and <strong>Topic Previewer</strong> window can be opened by
selecting their menu option on the <strong>View</strong> | <strong>Other Windows</strong> menu or from the <strong>Other Windows</strong>
toolbar button dropdown.  The build log tool window can be opened by selecting <strong>Build</strong> | <strong>View BuildLog Content</strong> or from the help file builder's toolbar dropdown button.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>Shortcut keys have not been assigned to any of the help file builder menu and toolbar options
to prevent conflicts with default key assignments or custom key assignments that you might have made.  To
assign shortcut keys to help file builder options, select <strong>Tools</strong> | <strong>Options</strong>, expand the <strong>Environment</strong> category, and select the <strong>Keyboard</strong> sub-category.  From there, you can enter
part of the name of a help file builder option (i.e. <em>entityref</em>) to find
matching commands, select them in the list of matches, and assign new shortcuts keys to them as you see
fit.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="SourceControl"> Source Control Tips</h2>
<p>As noted above, using Visual Studio to manage help file builder projects provides access to the built-in
source control providers within it.  When making changes to a project or file within Visual Studio, source control
operations will occur as they normally do for any other project type.  If you edit a help file builder project or
its related files with both Visual Studio and the standalone GUI keep the following in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Files can be added and removed from the project while it is open in both Visual Studio and
the standalone GUI.  Both will prompt you to reload the project if they detect that it has been modified outside
of their respective environment.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The standalone GUI does not support source control.  As such, you must check the files out in
Visual Studio prior to saving any changes made to them in the standalone GUI.  It is best to check files out prior
to modifying them in the standalone GUI so that you can ensure that you have a current version of the file if
necessary.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you need to rename a file, it is recommended that you do it from within Visual Studio
rather than the standalone GUI so that the source control provider makes a note of the rename operation.  Such
changes made to a source controlled file in the standalone GUI may cause problems with keeping the file in synch
with the source control store.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Files can be safely added to a source controlled project from the standalone GUI.  However, when
you load the project or refresh it in Visual Studio, the new files will not automatically be added to source
control.  To remedy this situation, do the following from within Visual Studio:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Make sure the project node or one of its files is selected and use the <strong>Project</strong> | <strong>Show All Files</strong> option to show all files within the project folder including those
that are not part of the project.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Select each of the files that was added via the standalone GUI.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Right click on one of the selected files and select the <strong>Exclude From Project</strong>
context menu option.  This will exclude the files from the project.  Because the Show All Files option is enabled,
they will still appear as items in the solution explorer but with an icon that indicates their excluded state.</p>
</li>
<li><p>With the same set of files selected, right click on one of them again and select the <strong>Include In Project</strong> context menu option.  The files will be added to the project again and the source
control provider will automatically add them to the source control store.  Once done, the icons next to the files
will change to show that they are once again part of the project and that they have been added to source control.
Note that you may need to adjust the file's properties after adding them back to the project (i.e. files that
have an <strong>Image</strong> build action).</p>
