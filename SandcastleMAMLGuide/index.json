    "title": "bibliography/cite",
    "summary": "bibliography/cite The auto-generated bibliography feature, an extension provided by the presentation styles in the Sandcastle Help File Builder, allows an author to create an external bibliography data XML file and then share it between multiple topics by specifying short identifiers in cite elements that match one of the references contained in the file. When one or more cite elements are used, Sandcastle will automatically generate a bibliography for the topic in the place that the bibliography element is specified and the cite elements themselves will be replaced with hyperlinks to corresponding bookmarked entries in the bibliography section. Tip The bibliography element is typically specified immediately before the relatedTopics element that appears at the bottom of the topic. Usage To use citations, a bibliography data XML file must be created to store the identifiers and entries. Add the file to the project and specify the file's name in the Transformation Arguments section of the project properties, typically the BibliographyDataFile argument. An example file is shown below. Note that not all presentation styles support the bibliography elements such as Open XML-based styles. In such cases they will be ignored. Defining Citation Identifiers and Bibliography Entries If it does not already exist, add a new bibliography data file to the project. An item template is supplied with the help file builder standalone GUI and Visual Studio package. The suggested name is bibliography.xml but you can name it what you like. Set the BuildAction to None so that the build ignores it. Add content similar to the following to the bibliography XML file. <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?> <bibliography> <reference name=\"sandcastle activity\"> <title>Sandcastle Help File Builder Activity Statistics</title> <author>Eric Woodruff</author> <publisher>GitHub.com</publisher> <link>https://GitHub.com/EWSoftware/SHFB/pulse/monthly</link> </reference> <reference name=\"SHFB\"> <title>Sandcastle Help File Builder</title> <author>Eric Woodruff</author> <publisher>GitHub.com</publisher> <link>https://GitHub.com/EWSoftware/SHFB</link> </reference> </bibliography> The previous example defines a bibliography XML file that contains two reference elements, which can be referred to by cite elements in a MAML topic using the values of the name attributes. Tip Reference names are not case-sensitive. The title and author elements are required. The publisher and link elements are optional. The only supported content type for each element is plain text. Using the Bibliography in a MAML Topic Add a bibliography element to the topic, preferably just before the relatedTopics element (see example). Use cite elements to reference items in the bibliography. The inner text of the element is the value of the name attribute for the entry. Example The following example MAML topic uses multiple cite elements to reference bibliography entries defined in the bibliography.xml file. Warning The bibliography element is also specified in MAML topics so that a bibliography section is generated automatically near the bottom of the topic. <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?> <topic id=\"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000\" revisionNumber=\"1\"> <developerConceptualDocument xmlns=\"http://ddue.schemas.microsoft.com/authoring/2003/5\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <introduction> <para>This topic discusses Sandcastle's popularity.</para> </introduction> <section> <title>Sandcsatle's Popularity</title> <content> <para>Sandcastle is a popular download<cite>sandcastle activity</cite>.</para> <para>The Sandcastle Help File Builder<cite>shfb</cite> adds even more value.</para> <para>I expect Sandcastle's popularity<cite>sandcastle activity</cite> to increase as more community members become aware of its usefulness, with the help of projects like the Sandcastle Help File Builder<cite>shfb</cite>.</para> </content> </section> <!-- Place the bibliography before the relatedTopics section --> <bibliography/> <relatedTopics/> </developerConceptualDocument> </topic> Example Output Sandcastle is a popular download sandcastle activity.

    "summary": "code This element can be used to display a multi-line code fragment in a conceptual topic. For single lines or keywords, you can use the codeInline element. Usage Enter the element in the topic and specify a language using the language attribute. <code language=\"languageId\" [title=\"Optional title\"] [source=\"externalCodeFile\" [region=\"importRegion\"] [removeRegionMarkers=\"true | false\"]] [tabsize=\"###\"] [numberLines=\"true | false\"] [outlining=\"true | false\"] [keepSeeTags=\"true | false\"]> /// Code to display </code> Note The language and title attributes are supported by Sandcastle. All other attributes are implemented by the Code Block Component supplied with the SHFB. Refer to its help file for more information about the build component. Literal XML And Other Special Characters If you want to include XML or other unencoded information you can do one of the following: Utilize the source attribute to read it in from an external file instead. Use a CDATA section to encapsulate the code so that special characters and formatting are preserved. For example: /// <example> /// <code language=\"xml\" title=\"Example Configuration\"> /// <![CDATA[ /// <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?> /// <config> /// <path>C:\\Test\\</path> /// <filespec mask=\"*.txt\" /> /// </config>]]> /// </code> /// </example> Be sure to start the example code on a new line after the opening \" <![CDATA[ \" tag as shown so that the leading whitespace can be normalized correctly. Attributes The following attributes can be used to control how the code block is handled. language This attribute allows you to define the code language. Although optional, it is recommended that you always specify a language attribute if using Sandcastle alone. Many of the presentation styles rely on the language attribute to classify the code block and handle it in some way such as attaching it to a language filter or grouping it with like code blocks based on the syntax filters selected in the project. The Sandcastle Help File Builder's code block component will apply a default language if one is not specified. The possible language values are as follows: Language ID (case-insensitive) Language Syntax Used cs, C#, CSharp C# cpp, cpp#, C++, CPlusPlus C++ c C fs, f#, FSharp, fscript F# EcmaScript, js, JavaScript JavaScript jscript, jscript#, jscriptnet, JScript.NET JScript.NET VB, VB#, vbnet, VB.NET VB/VB.NET vbs, vbscript VBScript htm, html, xml, xsl XML XAML XAML jsharp, J# J# sql, sql server, sqlserver SQL script py, python Python pshell, powershell, ps1 PowerShell script bat, batch batch file script Anything else (i.e. \"none\") No language, no special handling. Warning The full name \" language \" should be used for the attribute name rather than the abbreviated form \" lang \". The reason is that the transformations used by the presentation styles expect the full name when they search for the language attribute. The abbreviated form is a legacy syntax that should be avoided. The code block component will auto-correct the attribute name so that it is not missed by the transformations. It is recommended that you always specify a language attribute. title This attribute allows you to add a title that appears before the code block. An example of its use would be to label the example with a description. If omitted, the language name will appear for the title. If you do not want a title on a particular block, set the title attribute to a single space (\" \"). source, region, and removeRegionMarkers These three attributes are extensions implemented by the code block build component. The source attribute is used to specify that the code block's content should be read from an external source code file. If used alone, the entire file is imported. The optional region attribute can be used to limit the code to a specific section of the file delimited with the named #region (#pragma region for C++). The #region and #endregion tags are excluded from the extracted section of code. This is not to be confused with the XML comments include element. This extension is intended to extract code from actual source files. This allows you to manage your code examples in buildable projects to test them for correctness as a project is developed and altered in the future. It also saves you from managing the code in the XML comments and does not require that the code be HTML encoded as it is when written in the comments. The code will be HTML encoded when it is read in for processing. When used, it is assumed that there is no code within the code element itself and thus it will always be self-closing. Here are some examples: Retrieve all code from an external file and use the VB.NET syntax to color it. The path is relative to the code block component's basePath configuration element. Typically, the base path is the path of the documentation project file. So, if your documentation project is in a subfolder and the code is in the parent folder in an Examples subfolder, the path would look like the following example. <code source=\"..\\Examples\\WholeDemo.vb\" language=\"vbnet\" /> Retrieve a specific #region from an external file. <code source=\"..\\Examples\\SeveralExamples.vb\" region=\"Example 1\" language=\"vbnet\" title=\"Example #1\" /> Note that VB.NET does not allow #Region and #End Region within a method body. Other file types such as XML, XAML, and SQL script do not understand #region statements. However, if you want to extract a region from a VB.NET method body or a section of another file type, you can add the region statements in comments to workaround the limitation. The component will still find it and extract the region. -------------------------------------------------------- VB.NET Example -------------------------------------------------------- Public Sub SomeMethod() ' #Region \"VB.NET Snippet\" Dim x As Integer For x = 1 To 10 Console.WriteLine(x) Next x ' #End Region End Sub -------------------------------------------------------- XAML Example -------------------------------------------------------- <Style x:Key=\"SpecialButton\" TargetType=\"{x:Type Button}\"> <Style.Triggers> <!-- #region XAML Snippet --> <Trigger Property=\"Button.IsMouseOver\" Value=\"true\"> <Setter Property = \"Background\" Value=\"Red\"/> </Trigger> <!-- #endregion --> </Style.Triggers> </Style> -------------------------------------------------------- SQL Example -------------------------------------------------------- -- #region SQL snippet Select * From tblName Where LastName = 'SMITH' -- #endregion /* #region Another snippet */ Select * From tblName Where FirstName = 'JOHN' /* #endregion */ The removeRegionMarkers attribute can be used to specify whether or not region markers within the imported code file or region are removed. If not specified or set to false, any nested region markers are left in the imported code block. If specified and set to true, nested region markers are removed from the imported code. This is useful for removing nested region markers from larger code samples that contain smaller snippets of code used in other examples. The default setting (false) can be overridden via the component configuration. tabSize When the code blocks are formatted by the build component, tab characters are replaced with a set number of spaces to preserve formatting. This attribute can be used to override the default setting for a language which is specified in the syntax file. For example, if the default tab size for a language is four, adding tabSize=\"8\" will force it to use eight spaces instead. If set to zero, the syntax file setting is used. This attribute sets the default tab size for unknown languages when used in the component's configuration. numberLines This attribute allows you to override the default setting in the component's configuration. For example, if the default setting is false to turn off line numbering, you can add numberLines=\"true\" to enable numbering on a specific code example. outlining This attribute allows you to override the default setting in the component's configuration. For example, if the default setting is false to not add collapsible regions, you can add outlining=\"true\" to enable collapsible regions on a specific code example. Note that if a code block contains no #region or #if blocks, outlining is automatically disabled and it will not reserve space in the margin for the markers. keepSeeTags When set to true, this attribute allows you to tell the build component's code colorizer to preserve see tags within the code so that they can be rendered as clickable links to the related topic. If set to false, the default, any see tags within the code will be colorized and passed through as literal text. When using this option, you may find that you need to specify inner text for the see tag so that the link text appears as you want it. If the self-closing version of the tag is used, Sandcastle will generally set the link text to the name of the item plus any parameters if it is a generic type or takes parameters which may not be appropriate within a code sample. Nested Code Elements You can import multiple code snippets into one common colorized code block by nesting code elements within a parent code element. On nested code elements, only the source and region attributes will be utilized. All other attributes that control colorization of the merged code block will be retrieved from the parent code element. <code title=\"Nested code elements example\" language=\"VB.NET\"> <code source=\"..\\Class1.vb\" region=\"Snippet #1\" /> <code source=\"..\\Class1.vb\" region=\"Snippet #2\" /> </code> Literal code can also be mixed in between the nested code elements. However, there are some limitations. All elements and literal code should be flush left within the parent code element or you will end up with additional spaces before the first line of each nested code element. There may still be additional spaces before the literal code. This is caused by the indentation included when the XML comments file is created by the compiler. If this is a problem, move the example to an include file and remove the excess leading whitespace. Use an include element to bring it into the XML comments. When done this way, the compiler preserves the spacing when writing the example out to the XML comments file. <code title=\"Nested code elements example\" language=\"VB.NET\"> <code source=\"..\\Class1.vb\" region=\"Snippet #1\" /> ' ... Some stuff happens here ... <code source=\"..\\Class1.vb\" region=\"Snippet #2\" /> </code> See Also Concepts Block Elements codeInline codeEntityReference codeReference"

Note When using the SHFBor the standalone build components from it, the Code Block Component offers the same set of features and several others for both inline and external code snippets. In addition, it supports many other languages and can import code from working source code files which allows you to pull in examples from working projects that you can maintain and build without having to update a separate example snippets file. As such, you may prefer to use it rather than the code snippets file. Usage To use a code reference, simply insert its ID as the inner text of a codeReference element anywhere within a topic. You can combine multiple snippets with a common example ID into one code reference by specifying their sample IDs as a comma-separated list after the hash character.

    "title": "table, tableHeader, row, entry",
    "summary": "table, tableHeader, row, entry This element is used to arrange data in a table format with rows and columns. An optional title and table header can also be included. Usage A table consists of the following elements: table This is the main element. All other table elements are nested within it and it has no attributes. title This is an optional element. If specified, it defines a title that will appear above the table. tableHeader This is an optional element. If specified, it should contain a single row element that defines the header row. This can be used to add titles to each column. The table header, if specified, will be styled differently in the rendered topic. row This element is used to define each row in the table. A table must contain at least one row. Each row must contain one or more entry elements that define the columns in the row. entry This element is used to define the columns in each row. The entry items can themselves contain other MAML elements, nested lists, tables, etc. Text should be contained in a para element. Tip The entry element supports an address attribute that can be used to link to a specific entry from another location. To render an empty cell, use a non-breaking space entity (&#160;). Note There are no provisions for spanning rows or columns as there is in HTML tables. As such, each row must contain the same number of columns. However, you can nest tables within an entry element which can be used to achieve a similar effect. Example <para>This link takes you to <link xlink:href=\"#Row3Cell1\">Row 3, Cell 1</link> in the first table.</para> <table> <title>A Simple Table with Title and Headers</title> <tableHeader> <row> <entry><para>Header 1</para></entry> <entry><para>Header 2</para></entry> <entry><para>Header 3</para></entry> </row> </tableHeader> <row> <entry><para>Row 1, Cell 1</para></entry> <entry><para>Row 1, Cell 2</para></entry> <entry><para>Row 1, Cell 3</para></entry> </row> <row> <entry><para>Row 2, Cell 1</para></entry> <entry><para>Row 2, Cell 2</para></entry> <entry><para>Row 2, Cell 3</para></entry> </row> <row> <entry address=\"Row3Cell1\"><para>This entry has an <codeInline>address</codeInline> attribute that can be used as a link target.</para></entry> <entry><para>Row 3, Cell 2</para></entry> <entry><para>Row 3, Cell 3</para></entry> </row> </table> <table> <tableHeader> <row> <entry><para>&#160;</para></entry> <entry><para>A Nested Table Example</para></entry> </row> </tableHeader> <row> <entry><mediaLink><image xlink:href=\"98a8a8b7-c374-40c7-902a-91c947bf107c\"/> </mediaLink> </entry> <entry> <table> <row> <entry><para>Cell 1</para></entry> <entry><para>Cell 2</para></entry> <entry><para>Cell 3</para></entry> <entry><para>Cell 4</para></entry> </row> <row> <entry><para>Cell 5</para></entry> <entry><para>Cell 6</para></entry> <entry><para>Cell 7</para></entry> <entry><para>Cell 8</para></entry> </row> <row> <entry><para>Cell 9</para></entry> <entry><para>Cell 10</para></entry> <entry><para>Cell 11</para></entry> <entry><para>Cell 12</para></entry> </row> </table> <para>The table above doesn't have a <codeInline>tableHeader</codeInline>.</para> </entry> </row> </table> Example Output This link takes you to Row 3, Cell 1 in the first table.

    "title": "Code Snippets File",
    "summary": "Code Snippets File The code snippets file allows you to define code samples outside of conceptual topic files. Each snippet has a unique ID that can be referenced in multiple topics using a codeReference MAML element so that the snippets do not have to be copied into each one. Automatic colorization and language filter synchronization is supported by specifying a language identifier on the code samples. Currently supported identifiers are VisualBasic, CSharp, ManagedCPlusPlus, JSharp, and JScript. Custom colorization rules can be added to the conceptual configuration file for the ExampleComponent. Note When using the SHFBor the standalone build components from it, the Code Block Component offers the same set of features and several others for both inline and external code snippets. In addition, it supports many other languages and can import code from working source code files which allows you to pull in examples from working projects that you can maintain and build without having to update a separate example snippets file. As such, you may prefer to use it rather than the code snippets file. Code Snippets File Format Below is an example of a code snippets file. <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" ?> <!-- This is an example code snippets file --> <examples> <item id=\"ClassDefinition#Define\"> <sampleCode language=\"CSharp\"> public class CSharpClass() { // Members go here } </sampleCode> <sampleCode language=\"VisualBasic\"> Public Class VBClass ' Members go here End Class </sampleCode> </item> <item id=\"CreateInstance#Local\"> <sampleCode language=\"CSharp\"> CSharpClass x = new CSharpClass(); </sampleCode> <sampleCode language=\"VisualBasic\"> Dim x As VBClass = New VBClass() </sampleCode> </item> <item id=\"CreateInstance#Static\"> <sampleCode language=\"CSharp\"> public static CSharpClass sharedInstance = new CSharpClass(); </sampleCode> <sampleCode language=\"VisualBasic\"> Public Shared sharedInstance As VBClass = New VBClass() </sampleCode> </item> </examples> The file consists of a root examples node that contains one or more item nodes. The item element has an id attribute that gives each one a unique identifier. This is used as the inner text of the codeReference element in a topic to represent the snippet. Note The ID value must consists of an example ID, a hash character (#), and a sample ID. The example and sample ID values are not case-sensitive. The example ID does not have to be unique. However, when combined with a sample ID, the entire value must be unique. Each item must contain one or more sampleCode elements with a language attribute identifying the language of the sample code. The valid language IDs are noted above. The inner XML of the sampleCode element is the code snippet. See Also Concepts Conceptual Content File Types codeReference"

There will be one companion file for each conceptual content topic.

The title element is required and contains the title to use for the topic. This will be used as the default link text. In cases where the title is not appropriate or is too long for link text and you use the topic in a link frequently, you can specify a linkText element that contains different text to use for the link.

Each is assigned a unique ID that is used to refer to the image in conceptual topic links. When a help file is built, all images referenced by an image link are copied to the help file's .\\Media folder. Any unused images are omitted. Note The SHFBdoes not use a media content file directly. Instead, images are managed as project file items and the media content file is created for you automatically at build time based on the property values on those items. Media Content File Format Below is an example of a media content file. <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?> <!-- This is an example media content file --> <stockSharedContentDefinitions> <item id=\"4cfacbe8-d100-471c-9d69-1dbcce50e316\"> <image file=\"..\\ProjectImages\\SmallInformation.png\"> <altText>Information</altText> </image> </item> <item id=\"6be7079d-a9d8-4189-9021-0f72d1642beb\"> <image file=\"..\\ProjectImages\\SandcastleLogoLarge.JPG\"> <altText>Sandcastle</altText> </image> </item> <item id=\"98a8a8b7-c374-40c7-902a-91c947bf107c\"> <image file=\"..\\ProjectImages\\SandcastleLogoSmall.jpg\" /> </item> <item id=\"b5d069f7-5daf-45ae-882c-4596ab2b724a\"> <image file=\"..\\ProjectImages\\SecuritySuccess.png\" /> </item> </stockSharedContentDefinitions> The file consists of a root stockSharedContentDefinitions node that contains one or more item nodes that represent the images. The item element has an id attribute that gives each one a unique identifier. This is used as the target of the media link elements in the topics. Within the item element is a required image element used to define the image. The file attribute should point to the location of the image file. A relative or absolute path can be used as long as it can be located at build time. If you would like to display alternate text when the mouse hovers over the image, nest an altText element within the image element as shown in the first item in the example above. The inner text for it defines the alternate text to display. Note The unique ID is not case-sensitive. The example above uses GUID values for the ID but you are free to use any unique value that you like. Warning Unlike topics, image files will retain their name when copied to the media folder. As such, if you add two images from different locations that have the same name, one will overwrite the other when the help file is built.

Note The token ID is not case-sensitive. Token Content The content of a token item can be anything you like and may include other MAML elements. In the examples above, they are used to define a commonly used link and some common text elements. When used with the Sandcastle Help File Builder, substitution tags such as BuildDate can also be used in the token content. Note If you embed MAML elements within a token, you must prefix each element name with \" ddue: \" (without the quotes) as shown in the example above. If not, the elements are inserted using the default empty namespace and they may not be processed by the topic transformations. See Also Concepts Conceptual Content File Types autoOutline token"

    "title": "Topic File",
    "summary": "Topic File The topic file is used to contain a single conceptual topic. Instead of HTML, conceptual content topics use Microsoft Assistance Markup Language (MAML). This is basically XML conforming to a well defined schema that describes the structure of the conceptual content much like XML comments describe the structure of the code comments. There is no layout or style information within the MAML files. Instead, they are ran through a series of transformations using Sandcastle's BuildAssembler tool similar to the reference (API) content so that they match it in appearance and features. This allows you to utilize the various build components to alter and extend the presentation style of the topics. Topic File Structure MAML defines several different content types, each used for a specific type of document (conceptual, glossary, how-to, reference, etc.). Each type has a specific structure with various required and optional XML elements. When building conceptual content, each topic requires a unique ID in the form of a globally unique identifier (GUID) and a revision number. These are specified in a containing topic element in the content file as shown in this example. While GUIDs are used throughout this guide and also by default in tools such as the Sandcastle Help File Builder, the IDs can be any value you like. GUIDs ensure unique values by default. If you chose to use more human readable IDs, you are responsible for ensuring that each topic's ID is unique. <!-- The topic element contains the unique ID and revision number --> <topic id=\"303c996a-2911-4c08-b492-6496c82b3edb\" revisionNumber=\"1\"> <!-- This element name will change based on the document type --> <developerConceptualDocument xmlns=\"http://ddue.schemas.microsoft.com/authoring/2003/5\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <!-- The content goes here --> </developerConceptualDocument> </topic> Note The topic element is not part of the MAML schema but is required in order to build the help file. The example topics below include a topic element with placeholder ID and RevisionNumber values. If you copy these files, be sure to replace the ID in each topic with a unique value of your own for each file that you create.

It is passed a configuration file containing a list of build components to use in transforming the topics into HTML and a manifest file that lists the topics to build. See Also: Sandcastle Code Block Component A custom build component that can be used to colorize code, add line numbering and/or collapsible section, and import code from working source code files. It can be used in both conceptual and reference builds. The component is integrated with the SHFBand is also available as a standalone component from the same project site for use in other tools or your own build scripts. See Also: Sandcastle, SHFB code snippets file A file used to store commonly used code snippets. The snippets can be inserted into a conceptual topic using the codeReference element. conceptual build A build that uses Sandcastle to produce help file topics using information extracted from conceptual content topics and their related files. See Also: ReferenceBuild, Sandcastle conceptual content A topic file that contains conceptual content. These can be used to add usage notes, walkthroughs, tutorials, etc. to a help file. Globally Unique Identifier, GUID A unique value that is associated with each conceptual topic and image in a project. When inserting links to topics or images, the ID is used to refer to them. This allows you to alter the names or locations of the topic files without having to change the name or location in each topic that references them. MAML An acronym that stands for Microsoft Assistance Markup Language. Conceptual content topics are composed of MAML elements. reference build A build that uses Sandcastle to produce help file topics using information extracted from managed assemblies and their associated XML comments files. See Also: ConceptualBuild, Sandcastle Sandcastle Sandcastle is a set of tools originally produced by Microsoft that can be used to build help files for .NET managed libraries, conceptual content, or a mix of both. Microsoft officially discontinued development in October 2012. The Sandcastle tools have been merged with the SHFBproject and are developed and supported there now as part of that project. See Also: SHFB Sandcastle Help File Builder, SHFB The SHFBis a standalone tool used to automate Sandcastle. It consists of a GUI front end that helps you manage and build help file projects. It uses a standard MSBuild format project file which can also be built from the command line using MSBuild or integrated into Visual Studio builds or other build scripts to produce a help file when your application projects are built. In addition, it provides a set of additional features beyond those supplied with Sandcastle that can improve your help file and make it easier to deploy. A Visual Studio integration package is also available for it that integrates the project management and build features into VisualStudioMinVersionor later. See Also: Sandcastle token, token file A token is used as a replaceable tag within a topic and is represented using a token element. The inner text of the element is a token name. The tokens are defined in a separate token file. They are an easy way to represent common items that you use regularly such as a common phrase or external link."

    "title": "Visual Studio IntelliSense",
    "summary": "Visual Studio IntelliSense This topic covers how to manually integrate MAML schema files into Visual Studio's global schema cache to provide IntelliSense when editing MAML topics within Visual Studio. Tip The Sandcastle Help File Builder Visual Studio package installs the MAML schemas automatically so that they are available in the Visual Studio global schema cache for you. You do not need to install them manually. Note Because changes are made to the Program Files folder, you will need administrative privileges to perform these updates. In the instructions below, %ProgramFiles(x86)% is used to refer to the Program Files folder. This will typically be C:\\Program Files on 32-bit systems and C:\\Program Files (x86) on 64-bit systems. You may need to alter the paths below if you installed Visual Studio in a different location. Update the Visual Studio root catalog file. This will be %ProgramFiles(x86)%\\MicrosoftVisual Studio [XX]\\Xml\\Schemas\\catalog.xml for Visual Studio 2015 and earlier or %ProgramFiles(x86)%\\Microsoft Visual Studio[XX][Edition]\\Xml\\Schemas\\catalog.xml for Visual Studio 2017 and later. \"[XX]\" will be the version such as 14.0 or 2017 and \"[Edition]\" will be the edition such as Community, Professional, or Enterprise. Add the following line to the end of the list in the SchemaCatalog element: <Catalog href=\"%SHFBROOT%Schemas/Authoring/catalog.xml\" /> By using the path to the copy of the files in the help file builder installation, it will always use the most recent version of the schema files. Restart any open instances of Visual Studio. IntelliSense should now work for all MAML topics automatically. Note When installed manually, updates to Visual Studio will likely reset the global schema cache undoing the changes made above. If that happens and you no longer see IntelliSense for MAML files, simply apply the changes again. See Also Concepts Schema Extensibility"

Usage Place the element within a topic's introduction element to produce an outline of the topic's section headings or within a section 's content element to produce an outline of the section's sub-sections. In either case, the outline will be created at the location of the auto-outline element. As such, you can control the placement of the outline within the text. Each section must have a title element as that is the text that will be used for the outline entry. In addition, an address attribute must be added to each section element to give it a unique ID that can be used as a link. You can also add an optional address attribute to the introduction element so that you can link back to it from a sub-section. An optional lead attribute can be specified to define the lead-in text displayed before the list of links. If not specified, default lead-in text is used. If set to the value none, the lead-in text will be omitted. An optional excludeRelatedTopics attribute can be specified. If set to True, the top-level auto-outline will exclude the Related Topics link. This can be useful if you simply want to list the main sections of the topic with some alternate lead-in text or no lead-in text at all. If a numeric inner text value is specified, the section headings down to the indicated depth will be included in the outline.

Usage should be restricted to the output of custom build components when needed. Usage Enter the element in the topic and specify the format-specific markup as the content. It can be used as a block or an inline element. An optional contentType attribute is supported that defines the type of content (Html, OpenXml, or Markdown). This allows only rendering the content based on the content type supported by the presentation style. When specified, presentation styles that only support Open XML will only render markup element content with a content type of \"OpenXml\". Presentation styles that only support Markdown will only render markup element content with a content type of \"Html\" or \"Markdown\". All others (Help 1, Microsoft Help Viewer, and website) will only render the content if the type is \"Html\". If the attribute is omitted, the content will be rendered regardless of the presentation style's formats whether or not they actually support it. Example <para>Here are some literal markup examples: <markup><br /><br /> This content is compatible with the all presentation style formats. <br /><br /> It is NOT recommended that you use the markup element for normal conceptual content when an equivalent MAML element already exists. Its use should be restricted to custom build components. </markup> <markup contentType=\"Html\"><br /><br /> <p>This content is only compatible with <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>Markdown</strong> presentation style formats.</p> <p>It is <strong>NOT</strong> recommended that you use the <em>markup</em> element for normal conceptual content when an equivalent <u>MAML element</u> already exists. Its use should be restricted to custom build components.</p> </markup> <markup contentType=\"Markdown\"><br /><br /> This content is only compatible with **Markdown** presentation style formats. It is **NOT** recommended that you use the _markup_ element for normal conceptual content when an equivalent <u>MAML element</u> already exists. Its use should be restricted to custom build components. </markup> <!-- For Open XML, span elements are converted to the appropriate matching style after transformation as long as it is a recognized style name used by the transformation.

    "href": "docs/schemaextensibility.html",
    "title": "Schema Extensibility",
    "summary": "Schema Extensibility This topic will explain how you can change the MAML schema so that you can use elements from other namespaces as well. This is useful when extending Sandcastle with build components that provide new elements because it still allows you to validate your topic files. Tip The Sandcastle version of the MAML schema files already contain the necessary changes. XML Schema Extensibility In general, XML schema provides the any element for declaring extensibility points in your schema. The any element has two attributes that control the extensibility contract. The namespace attribute allows you to either explicitly specify a closed set of namespaces that are allowed or to specify one of these pseudo-URIs: ##local This allows only to use elements that do not reside in any namespace. This is not what we want to use because it forces build component authors to declare all elements in the empty namespace. This could easily lead to name clashes between different build components. ##targetNamespace This only allows elements from the target namespace of the declaring schema. For our purposes this is useless because it would only allow elements from the MAML namespace (http://ddue.schemas.microsoft.com/authoring/2003/5). ##any This allows any namespace, including the target namespace of the declaring schema. We do not want to use this because it would also allow to use any element from the MAML namespace (http://ddue.schemas.microsoft.com/authoring/2003/5) itself and hence undermine the schema validation for MAML. ##other This allows any namespaces except the target namespace of the declaring schema. For our purposes this is ideal because it allows only to use elements from any namespace except the MAML namespace (http://ddue.schemas.microsoft.com/authoring/2003/5). The processContents attribute allows you to control the validation requirements. It can have one of following values: skip This is the least restrictive value. It specifies that the schema processor should not try to validate the contents of the new element, even if it is able to find a schema for it. strict This is the most restrictive setting. It requires the schema processor to always validate the contents of the new element. If it is not able to find such a schema an error is reported during validation. lax This is a compromise between the settings skip and strict. The schema processor will validate the schema if it is able to find a schema for the new element and will skip it if cannot find such a schema. For our purposes this is ideal because it allows build component authors to provide a schema for validation but does not force them to do so. Therefore, our extensibility points will all look like this: <any namespace=\"##other\" processContents=\"lax\" /> Extending Inline Text Build components might add elements that you can use inside a para element. Examples for such elements are: Linking These are elements that allow you to link to other topics. MAML itself already provides several elements for this purpose, such as the link element to link to conceptual topics, the codeEntityReference element to link to managed code APIs, and the externalLink element to link to some location in the internet. Semantics This category includes elements that are used to associate pieces of text with semantics. In many cases these semantics are made visible through a consistent formatting, such as italics or bold text. Amongst others MAML itself provides the localUri element for marking text as representing local paths and the ui element for marking text as representing elements in your user interface. To extend the para element we will extend the underlying type inlineType. Open the file inline.xsd, goto line 62, and add the any element to the type: <complexType name=\"inlineType\" mixed=\"true\"> <annotation> <documentation> The inlineType complexType describes a simple inline-only content model. It provides both text and elements with similarly simple content models. </documentation> </annotation> <choice minOccurs=\"0\" maxOccurs=\"unbounded\"> <group ref=\"maml:inlineGroup\"/> <element ref=\"maml:sharedContent\"/> <element name=\"conditionalSection\"> <complexType> <sequence> <element ref=\"maml:conditions\"/> <element name=\"conditionalContent\" type=\"maml:inlineType\"/> </sequence> </complexType> </element> <!-- PATCH HERE --> <any namespace=\"##other\" processContents=\"lax\" /> </choice> <attributeGroup ref=\"maml:contentIdentificationSharingAndConditionGroup\"/> </complexType> Extending Related Topics For build components that provide elements for linking we also want to be able to use them inside the relatedTopics element. To do this, we will extend the type relatedTopicsType. Open the file hierarchy.xsd, goto line 123 and add the any element to the type: <complexType name=\"relatedTopicsType\" mixed=\"false\"> <choice minOccurs=\"0\" maxOccurs=\"unbounded\"> <group ref=\"maml:relatedTopicLinkGroup\"/> <!-- PATCH HERE --> <any namespace=\"##other\" processContents=\"lax\" /> </choice> <attributeGroup ref=\"maml:contentIdentificationSharingAndConditionGroup\"/> </complexType> Extending Section Structure Last but not least build components might also provide elements that allow you to build a structure. For this purpose MAML itself already provides the table, code, and para elements. To allow new structural elements we have to extend the type sectionContentType. Open the file structure.xsd, goto line 66 and add the any element to the type: <complexType name=\"sectionContentType\" mixed=\"false\"> <choice minOccurs=\"0\" maxOccurs=\"unbounded\"> <group ref=\"maml:structureGroup\"/> <element name=\"conditionalSection\" type=\"maml:conditionalSectionType\"/> <!-- PATCH HERE --> <any namespace=\"##other\" processContents=\"lax\" /> </choice> <attributeGroup ref=\"maml:contentIdentificationSharingAndConditionGroup\"/> </complexType> See Also Concepts Visual Studio IntelliSense"

    "summary": "Welcome Welcome to the Sandcastle MAML Guide. This is intended to be a reference that you can use to find out all that you need to know about Microsoft Assistance Markup Language (MAML) as used with Sandcastle to produce help files containing conceptual content. If you have any information, tips, updates, or corrections that you would like to see added to the guide, feel free to submit them to the author using the SendComments link in the page footer. What is Conceptual Content? Conceptual content allows you to define non-API documentation that is included in the help file for usage notes, walkthroughs, tutorials, etc. Instead of HTML, conceptual content topics use Microsoft Assistance Markup Language (MAML). This is basically XML conforming to a well defined schema that describes the structure of the conceptual content much like XML comments describe the structure of the code comments. There is no layout or style information within the MAML files. Instead, they are ran through a series of transformations using Sandcastle's BuildAssembler tool similar to the reference (API) content so that they match it in appearance and features. This allows you to utilize the various Sandcastle and third-party build components to alter and extend the presentation style used in the topics. The term \"conceptual content\" is actually a catch-all term used to refer to the various types of content that may appear in the help file. MAML actually defines several different content types, each used for a specific type of document (conceptual, glossary, how-to, reference, etc.). Each type has a specific structure with various required and optional XML elements. This help file will let you get to know the various document and element types. Creating Conceptual Content Creating the actual topic files is just a matter of entering the content using a text editor. Creating a help file from them requires several configuration files and the Sandcastle tools. If you are going to build a help file using Sandcastle alone, see the topics in the Conceptual Content File Types section. They cover the various file types that are used in the build process. If you prefer a more visual and automated approach to managing and building help files, it is strongly recommended that you use one of the third-party tools such as the SHFB. They contain all of the necessary features and tools required to make building help files with Sandcastle a much simpler process. This help file was produced using the SHFBand is an example of what the Default 2022 presentation style looks like.
